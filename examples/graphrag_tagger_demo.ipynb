These models, built on Transformer [161] architectures and trained\\non diverse and extensive datasets, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding,\\ninterpreting, and generating human language. The impact of these advancements is profound,\\nstretching across various sectors including healthcare [103, 166, 203], finance [93, 125], and educa-\\ntion [46, 169], where they facilitate more nuanced and efficient interactions between humans and\\nmachines.', 'tion [46, 169], where they facilitate more nuanced and efficient interactions between humans and\\nmachines.\\nDespite their remarkable language comprehension and text generation capabilities, LLMs may\\nexhibit limitations due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, real-time updated information,\\nand proprietary knowledge, which are outside LLMs’ pre-training corpus. These gaps can lead\\nto a phenomenon known as “hallucination” [61] where the model generates inaccurate or even\\nfabricated information. Consequently, it is imperative to supplement LLMs with external knowledge\\nto mitigate this problem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [34, 45, 59, 62, 178, 195, 202]\\nemerged as a significant evolution, which aims to enhance the quality and relevance of generated\\ncontent by integrating a retrieval component within the generation process. The essence of RAG\\nlies in its ability to dynamically query a large text corpus to incorporate relevant factual knowledge\\ninto the responses generated by the underlying language models. This integration not only enriches\\nthe contextual depth of the responses but also ensures a higher degree of factual accuracy and\\nspecificity. RAG has gained widespread attention due to its exceptional performance and broad', 'specificity. RAG has gained widespread attention due to its exceptional performance and broad\\napplications, becoming a key focus within the field.\\nAlthough RAG has achieved impressive results and has been widely applied across various\\ndomains, it faces limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Neglecting Relationships: In practice, textual\\ncontent is not isolated but interconnected. Traditional RAG fails to capture significant structured\\nrelational knowledge that cannot be represented through semantic similarity alone. For instance, in\\na citation network where papers are linked by citation relationships, traditional RAG methods focus\\non finding the relevant papers based on the query but overlook important citation relationships\\nbetween papers. (2) Redundant Information: RAG often recounts content in the form of textual\\nsnippets when concatenated as prompts. This makes context become excessively lengthy, leading\\nto the “lost in the middle” dilemma [104]. (3) Lacking Global Information: RAG can only retrieve a\\nsubset of documents and fails to grasp global information comprehensively, and hence struggles\\nwith tasks such as Query-Focused Summarization (QFS).\\nGraph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) [32, 58, 119] emerges as an innovative', 'Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) [32, 58, 119] emerges as an innovative\\nsolution to address these challenges. Unlike traditional RAG, GraphRAG retrieves graph elements\\ncontaining relational knowledge pertinent to a given query from a pre-constructed graph database,\\nas depicted in Figure 1. These elements may include nodes, triples, paths, or subgraphs, which are\\nutilized to generate responses. GraphRAG considers the interconnections between texts, enabling a\\nmore accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relational information. Additionally, graph data, such\\nas knowledge graphs, offer abstraction and summarization of textual data, thereby significantly\\nshortening the length of the input text and mitigating concerns of verbosity. By retrieving subgraphs\\nor graph communities, we can access comprehensive information to effectively address the QFS\\nchallenge by capturing the broader context and interconnections within the graph structure.\\nJ.

Furthermore, during the construction\\nof graph data, raw text data may undergo filtering and summarization processes, enhancing the\\nrefinement of information within the graph data. Although previous surveys on RAG have touched\\nupon GraphRAG, they predominantly center on textual data integration. This paper diverges by\\nplacing a primary emphasis on the indexing, retrieval, and utilization of structured graph data,\\nwhich represents a substantial departure from handling purely textual information and spurs the\\nemergence of many new techniques.\\n2.2\\nLLMs on Graphs\\nLLMs are revolutionizing natural language processing due to their excellent text understanding,\\nreasoning, and generation capabilities, along with their generalization and zero-shot transfer', 'reasoning, and generation capabilities, along with their generalization and zero-shot transfer\\nabilities. Although LLMs are primarily designed to process pure text and struggle with non-\\nEuclidean data containing complex structural information, such as graphs [49, 165], numerous\\nstudies [17, 35, 74, 92, 102, 116, 130, 131, 173, 204] have been conducted in these fields. These papers\\nprimarily integrate LLMs with GNNs to enhance modeling capabilities for graph data, thereby\\nimproving performance on downstream tasks such as node classification, edge prediction, graph\\nclassification, and others. For example, Zhu et al. [204] propose an efficient fine-tuning method\\nnamed ENGINE, which combines LLMs and GNNs through a side structure for enhancing graph\\nrepresentation.\\nDifferent from these methods, GraphRAG focuses on retrieving relevant graph elements using\\nqueries from an external graph-structured database.

The graph database can originate from public knowledge\\ngraphs [4, 10, 100, 142, 150, 163], graph data [123], or be constructed based on proprietary data\\nsources such as textual [32, 51, 89, 172] or other forms of data [183]. The indexing process typi-\\ncally includes mapping node and edge properties, establishing pointers between connected nodes,\\nand organizing data to support fast traversal and retrieval operations. Indexing determines the\\ngranularity of the subsequent retrieval stage, playing a crucial role in enhancing query efficiency.', 'granularity of the subsequent retrieval stage, playing a crucial role in enhancing query efficiency.\\nGraph-Guided Retrieval (G-Retrieval). Following graph-based indexing, the graph-guided retrieval\\nphase focuses on extracting pertinent information from the graph database in response to user\\nqueries or input. Specifically, given a user query 𝑞which is expressed in natural language, the\\nretrieval stage aims to extract the most relevant elements (e.g., entities, triplets, paths, subgraphs)\\nfrom knowledge graphs, which can be formulated as\\n𝐺∗= G-Retriever(𝑞, G)\\n= arg max\\n𝐺⊆R(G)\\n𝑝𝜃(𝐺|𝑞, G)\\n= arg max\\n𝐺⊆R(G)\\nSim(𝑞,𝐺),\\n(5)\\nwhere 𝐺∗is the optimal retrieved graph elements and Sim(·, ·) is a function that measures the\\nsemantic similarity between user queries and the graph data. R(·) represents a function to narrow\\ndown the search range of subgraphs, considering the efficiency.', 'down the search range of subgraphs, considering the efficiency.\\nJ.

The graph-enhanced generation phase involves\\nsynthesizing meaningful outputs or responses based on the retrieved graph data. This could\\nencompass answering user queries, generating reports, etc. In this stage, a generator takes the\\nquery, retrieved graph elements, and an optional prompt as input to generate a response, which\\ncan be denoted as\\n𝑎∗= G-Generator(𝑞,𝐺∗)\\n= arg max\\n𝑎∈𝐴\\n𝑝𝜙(𝑎|𝑞,𝐺∗)\\n= arg max\\n𝑎∈𝐴\\n𝑝𝜙(𝑎|F (𝑞,𝐺∗)),\\n(6)\\nwhere F (·, ·) is a function that converts graph data into a form the generator can process.\\n5\\nGraph-Based Indexing\\nThe construction and indexing of graph databases form the foundation of GraphRAG, where\\nthe quality of the graph database directly impacts GraphRAG’s performance. In this section, we', 'the quality of the graph database directly impacts GraphRAG’s performance. In this section, we\\ncategorize and summarize the selection or construction of graph data and various indexing methods\\nthat have been employed.\\n5.1\\nGraph Data\\nVarious types of graph data are utilized in GraphRAG for retrieval and generation. Here, we\\ncategorize these data into two categories based on their sources, including Open Knowledge Graphs\\nand Self-Constructed Graph Data.\\n5.1.1\\nOpen Knowledge Graphs. Open knowledge graphs refer to graph data sourced from publicly\\navailable repositories or databases [4, 10, 150, 163]. Using these knowledge graphs could dramatically\\nreduce the time and resources required to develop and maintain. In this survey, we further classify\\nthem into two categories according to their scopes, i.e., General Knowledge Graphs and Domain\\nKnowledge Graphs.\\n(1) General Knowledge Graphs. General knowledge graphs primarily store general, structured\\nknowledge, and typically rely on collective input and updates from a global community, ensuring a\\ncomprehensive and continually refreshed repository of information.\\nEncyclopedic knowledge graphs are a typical type of general knowledge graph, which contains', 'Encyclopedic knowledge graphs are a typical type of general knowledge graph, which contains\\nlarge-scale real-world knowledge collected from human experts and encyclopedias. For example,\\nWikidata1 [163] is a free and open knowledge base that stores structured data of its Wikimedia\\nsister projects like Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, and others. Freebase2 [10] is an extensive,\\ncollaboratively edited knowledge base that compiles data from various sources, including individual\\ncontributions and structured data from databases like Wikipedia. DBpedia3 [4] represents informa-\\ntion about millions of entities, including people, places, and things, by leveraging the infoboxes\\nand categories present in Wikipedia articles. YAGO4 [150] collects knowledge from Wikipedia,\\nWordNet, and GeoNames.\\nCommonsense knowledge graphs are another type of general knowledge graph. They include\\nabstract commonsense knowledge, such as semantic associations between concepts and causal\\nrelationships between events. Typical Commonsense Knowledge Graphs include: ConceptNet5 [100]\\n1https://www.wikidata.org/\\n2http://www.freebase.be/\\n3https://www.dbpedia.org/', '2http://www.freebase.be/\\n3https://www.dbpedia.org/\\n4https://yago-knowledge.org/\\n5https://conceptnet.io/\\nJ.

ATOMIC [64, 142] models the causal relationships between events.\\n(2) Domain Knowledge Graphs. As discussed in Section 1, domain-specific knowledge graphs are\\ncrucial for enhancing LLMs in addressing domain-specific questions. These KGs offer specialized\\nknowledge in particular fields, aiding models in gaining deeper insights and a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding of complex professional relationships. In the biomedical field, CMeKG6 encompasses\\na wide range of data, including diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, and relationships\\nbetween medical concepts. CPubMed-KG7 is a medical knowledge database in Chinese, building on\\nthe extensive repository of biomedical literature in PubMed. In the movie domain, Wiki-Movies [121]\\nextracts structured information from Wikipedia articles related to films, compiling data about\\nmovies, actors, directors, genres, and other relevant details into a structured format. Additionally, Jin\\net al. [75] construct a dataset named GR-Bench, which includes five domain knowledge graphs', 'et al. [75] construct a dataset named GR-Bench, which includes five domain knowledge graphs\\nspanning academic, E-commerce, literature, healthcare, and legal fields. Furthermore, He et al.\\n[55] convert triplet-format and JSON files from ExplaGraphs and SceneGraphs into a standard\\ngraph format and selects questions requiring 2-hop reasoning from WebQSP to create the universal\\ngraph-format dataset GraphQA for evaluating GraphRAG systems.\\n5.1.2\\nSelf-Constructed Graph Data. Self-Constructed Graph Data facilitates the customization and\\nintegration of proprietary or domain-specific knowledge into the retrieval process. For downstream\\ntasks that do not inherently involve graph data, researchers often propose constructing a graph\\nfrom multiple sources (e.g., documents, tables, and other databases) and leveraging GraphRAG to\\nenhance task performance. Generally, these self-constructed graphs are closely tied to the specific\\ndesign of the method, distinguishing them from the open-domain graph data previously mentioned.\\nTo model the structural relationships between the documents, Munikoti et al. [124] propose to\\nconstruct a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple document-level relations, including\\nco-citation, co-topic, co-venue, etc.', 'co-citation, co-topic, co-venue, etc.\\nLi et al. [96] and Wang et al. [172] establish relationship\\nbetween passages according to shared keywords. To capture the relations between entities in\\ndocuments,\\nDelile et al. [26] , Edge et al. [32] , Gutiérrez et al. [51] and Li et al. [89] utilize the\\nnamed entity recognition tools to extract entities from documents and language models to further\\nextract relations between entities, where the retrieved entities and relations then form a knowledge\\ngraph. There are also some mapping methods for downstream tasks that need to be designed based\\non the characteristics of the task itself. For example, to solve the patent phrase similarity inference\\ntask, Peng and Yang [133] convert the patent database into a patent-phrase graph. Connections\\nbetween patent nodes and phrase nodes are established if the phrases appear in the patents, while\\nconnections between patent nodes are based on citation relations. Targeting customer service\\ntechnical support scenarios, Xu et al. [183] propose to model historical issues into a KG, which\\ntransforms the issues into tree representations to maintain the intra-issue relations, and utilize', 'transforms the issues into tree representations to maintain the intra-issue relations, and utilize\\nsemantic similarities and a threshold to preserve inter-issue relations.\\n5.2\\nIndexing\\nGraph-Based Indexing plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and speed of query operations\\non graph databases, directly influencing subsequent retrieval methods and granularity. Common\\ngraph-based indexing methods include graph indexing, text indexing, and vector indexing.\\n5.2.1\\nGraph Indexing.

During subsequent retrieval stages, classic graph search\\nalgorithms such as BFS and Shortest Path Algorithms can be employed to facilitate retrieval\\ntasks [73, 75, 112, 113, 154, 158, 189].\\n5.2.2\\nText Indexing. Text indexing involves converting graph data into textual descriptions to\\noptimize retrieval processes. These descriptions are stored in a text corpus, where various text-based\\nretrieval techniques, such as sparse retrieval and dense retrieval, can be applied. Some approaches\\ntransform knowledge graphs into human-readable text using predefined rules or templates. For\\ninstance,', 'transform knowledge graphs into human-readable text using predefined rules or templates. For\\ninstance,\\nLi et al. [90] , Huang et al. [63] and Li et al. [95] use predefined templates to convert\\neach triple in knowledge graphs into natural language, while Yu et al. [193] merge triplets with\\nthe same head entity into passages. Additionally, some methods convert subgraph-level information\\ninto textual descriptions. For example, Edge et al. [32] perform community detection on the graph\\nand generate summaries for each community using LLMs.\\n5.2.3\\nVector Indexing. Vector indexing transforms graph data into vector representations to en-\\nhance retrieval efficiency, facilitating rapid retrieval and effective query processing. For example,\\nentity linking can be seamlessly applied through query embeddings, and efficient vector search\\nalgorithms such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [66] can be utilized. G-Retriever [55] em-\\nploys language models to encode textual information associated with each node and edge within\\nthe graph, while GRAG [58] uses language models to convert 𝑘-hop ego networks into graph\\nembeddings, thereby better preserving structural information.', 'embeddings, thereby better preserving structural information.\\n5.2.4\\nHybrid Indexing. Each of the above three indexing methods offers distinct advantages: graph\\nindexing facilitates easy access to structural information, text indexing simplifies retrieval of\\ntextual content, and vector indexing enables quick and efficient searches. Therefore, in practical\\napplications, a hybrid approach combining these indexing methods is often preferred over relying\\nsolely on one. For instance, HybridRAG [144] retrieves both vector and graph data simultaneously\\nto enhance the content retrieved. While EWEK-QA [24] uses both text and knowledge graphs.\\n6\\nGraph-Guided Retrieval\\nIn GraphRAG, the retrieval process is crucial for ensuring the quality and relevance of generated\\noutputs by extracting pertinent and high-quality graph data from external graph databases.

The general architectures of Graph-Guided Retrieval are', 'and effective enhancement techniques. The general architectures of Graph-Guided Retrieval are\\ndepicted in Figure 4.\\n6.1\\nRetriever\\nIn GraphRAG, various retrievers possess unique strengths for addressing different aspects of\\nretrieval tasks. We categorize retrievers into three types based on their underlying models: Non-\\nparametric Retriever, LM-based Retriever, and GNN-based Retriever. It is important to note that\\nmodels used in pre-processing steps, such as query encoding and entity linking, are not considered\\nhere, as these models vary across different methods and are not the primary focus of this paper.\\n6.1.1\\nNon-parametric Retriever. Non-parametric retrievers, based on heuristic rules or traditional\\ngraph search algorithms, do not rely on deep-learning models, thereby achieving high retrieval\\nefficiency. For instance,\\nYasunaga et al. [189] and Taunk et al. [158] retrieve 𝑘-hop paths\\ncontaining the topic entities of each question-choice pair. G-Retriever [55] enhances the conven-', 'containing the topic entities of each question-choice pair. G-Retriever [55] enhances the conven-\\ntional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) algorithm by incorporating edge prices and optimizing\\nrelevant subgraph extraction.\\nDelile et al. [26] and Mavromatis and Karypis [119] first extract\\nentities mentioned in the query and then retrieve the shortest path related to these entities. These\\nmethods often involve an entity linking pre-processing step to identify nodes in the graph before\\nretrieval.\\n6.1.2\\nLM-based Retriever. LMs serve as effective retrievers in GraphRAG due to their strong natural\\nlanguage understanding capabilities. These models excel in processing and interpreting diverse\\nnatural language queries, making them versatile for a wide range of retrieval tasks within graph-\\nbased frameworks. We primarily categorized LMs into two types: discriminative and generative\\nlanguage models. Subgraph Retriever [196] trains RoBERTa [107] as the retriever, which expands\\nfrom the topic entity and retrieves the relevant paths in a sequential decision process. KG-GPT [80]', 'from the topic entity and retrieves the relevant paths in a sequential decision process. KG-GPT [80]\\nadopts LLMs to generate the set of top-𝐾relevant relations of the specific entity. Wold et al. [176]\\nutilize fine-tuned GPT-2 to generate reasoning paths. StructGPT [67] utilizes LLMs to automatically\\ninvoke several pre-defined functions, by which relevant information can be retrieved and combined\\nto assist further reasoning.\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.', '111:12\\nPeng et al.\\n6.1.3\\nGNN-based Retriever. GNNs are adept at understanding and leveraging complex graph\\nstructures. GNN-based retrievers typically encode graph data and subsequently score different\\nretrieval granularities based on their similarity to the query. For example, GNN-RAG [119] first\\nencodes the graph, assigns a score to each entity, and retrieves entities relevant to the query based\\non a threshold. EtD [99] iterates multiple times to retrieve relevant paths. During each iteration, it\\nfirst uses LLaMA2 [160] to select edges connecting the current node, then employs GNNs to obtain\\nembeddings of the new layer of nodes for the next round of LLM selection.\\n6.1.4\\nDiscussion. During the retrieval process, non-parametric retrievers exhibit good retrieval\\nefficiency, but they may suffer from inaccurate retrieval due to a lack of training on downstream\\ntasks. Meanwhile, although LM-based retrievers and GNN-based retrievers offer higher retrieval\\naccuracy, they require significant computational overhead. Considering this complementarity, many\\nmethods propose hybrid retrieval approaches to improve both retrieval efficiency and accuracy.', 'methods propose hybrid retrieval approaches to improve both retrieval efficiency and accuracy.\\nMany approaches adopt a multi-stage retrieval strategy, employing different models at each stage.\\nFor example, RoG [112] first utilizes LLMs to generate planning paths and then extracts paths\\nsatisfying the planning paths from knowledge graphs. GenTKGQA [44] infers crucial relations and\\nconstraints from the query using LLMs and extracts triplets according to these constraints.\\n6.2\\nRetrieval Paradigm\\nWithin GraphRAG, different retrieval paradigms, including once retrieval, iterative retrieval, and\\nmulti-stage retrieval, play crucial roles in improving the relevance and depth of the retrieved\\ninformation. Once retrieval aims to gather all pertinent information in a single operation. Iterative\\nretrieval conducts further searches based on previously retrieved information, progressively nar-\\nrowing down to the most relevant results. Here we further divide iterative retrieval into adaptive\\nretrieval and non-adaptive retrieval, with the only difference lying in whether the stopping of the\\nretrieval is determined by the model. Another retrieval paradigm is multi-stage retrieval, where\\nretrieval is divided into multiple stages. Different types of retrievers may be employed at each stage', 'retrieval is divided into multiple stages. Different types of retrievers may be employed at each stage\\nfor more precise and diversified search results. Below, we will provide a detailed introduction to\\nthese types of retrieval paradigms.\\n6.2.1\\nOnce Retrieval. Once retrieval aims to retrieve all the relevant information in a single query.\\nOne category of approaches [51, 58, 90] utilize embedding similarities to retrieve the most relevant\\npieces of information. Another category of methods design pre-defined rules or patterns to directly\\nextract specific structured information such as triplets, paths or subgraphs from graph databases.\\nFor example, G-Retriever [55] utilizes an extended PCST algorithm to retrieve the most relevant\\nsubgraph. KagNet [97] extracts paths between all pairs of topic entities with lengths not exceeding\\n𝑘.\\nYasunaga et al. [189] and Taunk et al. [158] extract the subgraph that contains all topic entities\\nalong with their 2-hop neighbors.\\nFurthermore, in this subsection, we also include some multiple retrieval methods that involve\\ndecoupled and independent retrievals, allowing them to be computed in parallel and executed only', 'decoupled and independent retrievals, allowing them to be computed in parallel and executed only\\nonce. For example,\\nLuo et al. [112] and Cheng et al. [20] first instruct LLMs to generate multiple\\nreasoning paths and then use a BFS retriever to sequentially search for subgraphs in the knowledge\\ngraphs that match each path. KG-GPT [80] decomposes the original query into several sub-queries,\\nretrieving relevant information for each sub-query in a single retrieval process.\\n6.2.2\\nIterative Retrieval. In iterative retrieval, multiple retrieval steps are employed, with sub-\\nsequent searches depending on the results of prior retrievals. These methods aim to deepen the\\nunderstanding or completeness of the retrieved information over successive iterations. In this\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.', 'Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey\\n111:13\\nsurvey, we further classify iterative retrieval into two categories: (1) non-adaptive and (2) adaptive\\nretrieval. We provide a detailed summary of these two categories of methods below.\\n(1) Non-Adaptive Retrieval. Non-adaptive methods typically follow a fixed sequence of retrieval,\\nand the termination of retrieval is determined by setting a maximum time or a threshold. For\\nexample, PullNet [151] retrieves problem-relevant subgraphs through𝑇iterations. In each iteration,\\nthe paper designs a retrieval rule to select a subset of retrieved entities, and then expands these\\nentities by searching relevant edges in the knowledge graph. In each iteration, KGP [172] first\\nselects seed nodes based on the similarity between the context and the nodes in the graph. It then\\nuses LLMs to summarize and update the context of the neighboring nodes of the seed nodes, which\\nis utilized in the subsequent iteration.\\n(2) Adaptive Retrieval. One distinctive characteristic of adaptive retrieval is to let models au-\\ntonomously determine the optimal moments to finish the retrieval activities. For instance, [50, 182]', 'tonomously determine the optimal moments to finish the retrieval activities. For instance, [50, 182]\\nleverage an LM for hop prediction, which serves as an indicator to end the retrieval. There is also a\\ngroup of researchers who utilize model-generated special tokens or texts as termination signals for\\nthe retrieval process. For example, ToG [113, 154] prompts the LLM agent to explore the multiple\\npossible reasoning paths until the LLM determines the question can be answered based on the\\ncurrent reasoning path. [196] trains a RoBERTa to expand a path from each topic entity. In the\\nprocess, a virtual relation named as “[END]” is introduced to terminate the retrieval process.\\nAnother common approach involves treating the large model as an agent, enabling it to directly\\ngenerate answers to questions to signal the end of iteration. For instance, [67, 69, 75, 155, 170]\\npropose LLM-based agents to reason on graphs. These agents could autonomously determine the\\ninformation for retrieval, invoke the pre-defined retrieval tools, and cease the retrieval process\\nbased on the retrieved information.\\n6.2.3', 'based on the retrieved information.\\n6.2.3\\nMulti-Stage Retrieval. Multi-stage retrieval divides the retrieval process linearly into multiple\\nstages, with additional steps such as retrieval enhancement, and even generation processes occur-\\nring between these stages. In multi-stage retrieval, different stages may employ various types of\\nretrievers, which enables the system to incorporate various retrieval techniques tailored to different\\naspects of the query. For example, Wang et al. [171] first utilize a non-parametric retriever to\\nextract 𝑛-hop paths of entities in the query’s reasoning chain, then after a pruning stage, it further\\nretrieves the one-hop neighbors of the entities in the pruned subgraph. OpenCSR [53] divides the\\nretrieval process into two stages. In the first stage, it retrieves all 1-hop neighbors of the topic\\nentity. In the second stage, it compares the similarity between these neighbor nodes and other\\nnodes, selecting the top-𝑘nodes with the highest similarity for retrieval. GNN-RAG [119] first\\nemploys GNNs to retrieve the top-𝑘nodes most likely to be the answer. Subsequently, it retrieves', 'all shortest paths between query entities and answer entities pairwise.\\n6.2.4\\nDiscussion. In GraphRAG, once retrieval typically exhibits lower complexity and shorter\\nresponse times, making it suitable for scenarios requiring real-time responsiveness. In contrast,\\niterative retrieval often involves higher time complexity, especially when employing LLMs as\\nretrievers, potentially leading to longer processing times. However, this approach can yield higher\\nretrieval accuracy by iteratively refining retrieved information and generating responses. Therefore,\\nthe choice of retrieval paradigm should balance accuracy and time complexity based on specific\\nuse cases and requirements.\\n6.3\\nRetrieval Granularity\\nAccording to different task scenarios and indexing types, researchers design distinct retrieval\\ngranularities (i.e., the form of related knowledge retrieved from graph data), which can be divided\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.', '111:14\\nPeng et al.\\ninto nodes, triplets, paths, and subgraphs. Each retrieval granularity has its own advantages, making\\nit suitable for different practical scenarios. We will introduce the details of these granularities in\\nthe following sections.\\n6.3.1\\nNodes. Nodes allow for precise retrieval focused on individual elements within the graph,\\nwhich is ideal for targeted queries and specific information extraction. In general, for knowledge\\ngraphs, nodes refer to entities. For other types of text attribute graphs, nodes may include textual\\ninformation that describes the node’s attributes. By retrieving nodes within the graph, GraphRAG\\nsystems could provide detailed insights into their attributes, relationships, and contextual informa-\\ntion. For example,\\nMunikoti et al. [124] , Li et al. [96] and Wang et al. [172] construct document\\ngraphs and retrieves relevant passage nodes.\\nLiu et al. [99] , Sun et al. [151] and Gutiérrez et al.\\n[51] retrieve entities from constructed knowledge graphs.\\n6.3.2', '[51] retrieve entities from constructed knowledge graphs.\\n6.3.2\\nTriplets. Generally, triplets consist of entities and their relationships in the form of subject-\\npredicate-object tuples, providing a structured representation of relational data within a graph. The\\nstructured format of triplets allows for clear and organized data retrieval, making it advantageous\\nin scenarios where understanding relationships and contextual relevance between entities is\\ncritical. Yang et al. [185] retrieve triplets containing topic entities as relevant information.\\nHuang\\net al. [63] , Li et al. [90] and Li et al. [95] first convert each triplet of graph data into textual\\nsentences using predefined templates and subsequently adopt a text retriever to extract relevant\\ntriplets. However, directly retrieving triplets from graph data may still lack contextual breadth\\nand depth, thus being unable to capture indirect relationships or reasoning chains. To address this\\nchallenge, Wang et al. [164] propose to generate the logical chains based on the original question,\\nand retrieve the relevant triplets of each logical chain.\\n6.3.3\\nPaths. The retrieval of path-granularity data can be seen as capturing sequences of rela-', 'Paths. The retrieval of path-granularity data can be seen as capturing sequences of rela-\\ntionships between entities, enhancing contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. In\\nGraphRAG, retrieving paths offers distinct advantages due to their ability to capture complex\\nrelationships and contextual dependencies within a graph.\\nHowever, path retrieval can be challenging due to the exponential growth in possible paths as\\ngraph size increases, which escalates computational complexity. To address this, some methods\\nretrieve relevant paths based on pre-defined rules. For example,\\nWang et al. [171] and Lo and\\nLim [108] first select entity pairs in the query and then traverse to find all the paths between\\nthem within 𝑛-hop. HyKGE [73] first defines three types of paths: path, co-ancestor chain, and\\nco-occurrence chain, and then utilizes corresponding rules to retrieve each of these three types of\\npaths. In addition, some methods utilize models to perform path searching on graphs. ToG [113, 154]\\nproposes to prompt the LLM agent to perform the beam search on KGs and find multiple possible\\nreasoning paths that help answer the question.', 'reasoning paths that help answer the question.\\nLuo et al. [112] , Wu et al. [182] and Guo et al.\\n[50] first utilizes the model to generate faithful reasoning plans and then retrieves relevant paths\\nbased on these plans. GNN-RAG [119] first identifies the entities in the question. Subsequently, all\\npaths between entities that satisfy a certain length relationship are extracted.\\n6.3.4\\nSubgraphs. Retrieving subgraphs offers significant advantages due to its ability to capture\\ncomprehensive relational contexts within a graph. This granularity enables GraphRAG to extract\\nand analyze complex patterns, sequences, and dependencies embedded within larger structures,\\nfacilitating deeper insights and a more nuanced understanding of semantic connections.\\nTo ensure both information completeness and retrieval efficiency, some methods propose an\\ninitial rule-based approach to retrieve candidate subgraphs, which are subsequently refined or\\nprocessed further. Peng and Yang [133] retrieve the ego graph of the patent phrase from the\\nself-constructed patent-phrase graph.\\nYasunaga et al. [189] , Feng et al. [40] and Taunk et al.', 'Yasunaga et al.

[89] extract two\\ntypes of graphs, including Path evidence subgraphs and Neighbor evidence subgraphs, based on\\npre-defined rules. OpenCSR [53] starts from a few initial seed nodes and gradually expands to new\\nnodes, eventually forming a subgraph.\\nIn addition to the aforementioned direct subgraph retrieval methods, some works propose first\\nretrieving relevant paths and then constructing related subgraphs from them. For instance, Zhang\\net al. [196] train a RoBERTa model to identify multiple reasoning paths through a sequential\\ndecision process, subsequently merging identical entities from different paths to induce a final\\nsubgraph.', 'decision process, subsequently merging identical entities from different paths to induce a final\\nsubgraph.\\n6.3.5\\nHybrid Granularties. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of various retrieval gran-\\nularities mentioned above, some researchers propose using hybrid granularities, that is, retrieving\\nrelevant information of multiple granularities from graph data. This type of granularity enhances\\nthe system’s ability to capture both detailed relationships and broader contextual understanding,\\nthus reducing noise while improving the relevance of the retrieved data.

(1) In real applications, there are no clear boundaries between these retrieval\\ngranularities, as subgraphs can be composed of multiple paths, and paths can be formed by several', 'granularities, as subgraphs can be composed of multiple paths, and paths can be formed by several\\ntriplets. (2) Various granularities such as nodes, triplets, paths, and subgraphs offer distinct advan-\\ntages in the GraphRAG process. Balancing between retrieval content and efficiency is crucial when\\nselecting the granularity, depending on the specific context of the task. For straightforward queries\\nor when efficiency is paramount, finer granularities such as entities or triplets may be preferred to\\noptimize retrieval speed and relevance. In contrast, complex scenarios often benefit from a hybrid\\napproach that combines multiple granularities. This approach ensures a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding of the graph structure and relationships, enhancing the depth and accuracy of\\nthe generated responses. Thus, GraphRAG’s flexibility in granularity selection allows it to adapt\\neffectively to diverse information retrieval needs across various domains.\\n6.4\\nRetrieval Enhancement\\nTo ensure high retrieval quality, researchers propose techniques to enhance both user queries and\\nthe knowledge retrieved. In this paper, we categorize query enhancement into query expansion and\\nquery decomposition, and knowledge enhancement into merging and pruning. These strategies', 'query decomposition, and knowledge enhancement into merging and pruning. These strategies\\ncollectively optimize the retrieval process. Although other techniques such as query rewriting [114,\\n117, 132, 137] are commonly used in RAG, they are less frequently applied in GraphRAG. We do\\nnot delve into these methods, despite their potential adaptation for GraphRAG.\\n6.4.1\\nQuery Enhancement. Strategies applied to queries typically involve pre-processing techniques\\nthat enrich the information for better retrieval. This may include query expansion and query\\ndecomposition.\\n(1) Query Expansion. Due to the generally short length of queries and their limited information\\ncontent, query expansion aims to improve search results by supplementing or refining the original\\nquery with additional relevant terms or concepts.

Cheng et al. [20] adopt SPARQL to get all the\\naliases of the query entities from Wikidata to augment the retrieval queries, which capture lexical\\nvariations of the same entity. Huang et al. [63] propose a consensus-view knowledge retrieval\\nmethod to improve retrieval accuracy, which first discover semantically relevant queries, and then\\nre-weight the original query terms to enhance the retrieval performance. HyKGE [73] utilizes a\\nlarge model to generate the hypothesis output of the question, concatenating the hypothesis output\\nwith the query as input to the retriever. Golden-Retriever [2] first recognizes the jargon in the\\nquery and then retrieves explanations of the jargon as a supplement to the query.\\n(2) Query Decomposition. Query decomposition techniques break down or decompose the original\\nuser query into smaller, more specific sub-queries. Each sub-query typically focuses on a particular\\naspect or component of the original query, which successfully alleviates the complexity and\\nambiguity of language queries. For instance, [22, 80] breaks down the primary question into sub-', 'ambiguity of language queries. For instance, [22, 80] breaks down the primary question into sub-\\nsentences, each representing a distinct relation, and sequentially retrieves the pertinent triplets for\\neach sub-sentence.\\n6.4.2\\nKnowledge Enhancement. After retrieving initial results, knowledge enhancement strategies\\nare employed to refine and improve the retriever’s results. This phase often involves knowledge\\nmerging and knowledge pruning processes to present the most pertinent information prominently.\\nThese techniques aim to ensure that the final set of retrieved results is not only comprehensive but\\nalso highly relevant to the user’s information needs.\\n(1) Knowledge Merging. Knowledge merging retrieved information enables compression and\\naggregation of information, which assists in obtaining a more comprehensive view by consolidating\\nrelevant details from multiple sources. This approach not only enhances the completeness and\\ncoherence of the information but also mitigates issues related to input length constraints in models.\\nKnowledgeNavigator [50] merges nodes and condenses the retrieved sub-graph through triple\\naggregation to enhance the reasoning efficiency. In Subgraph Retrieval [196], after retrieving top-𝑘\\npaths from each topic entity to form a single subgraph, researchers propose to merge the same', 'paths from each topic entity to form a single subgraph, researchers propose to merge the same\\nentities from different subgraphs to form the final subgraph.\\nWen et al. [175] and Li et al. [89]\\nmerge retrieved subgraphs based on relations, combining head entities and tail entities that satisfy\\nthe same relation into two distinct entity sets, ultimately forming a relation paths.\\n(2) Knowledge Pruning. Knowledge pruning involves filtering out less relevant or redundant\\nretrieved information to refine the results. Previous approaches for pruning encompass two main\\ncategories: (re)-ranking-based approaches and LLM-based approaches. (Re)-ranking methods in-\\nvolve the reordering or prioritization of retrieved information using tailored metrics or criteria.\\nOne line of methods introduces stronger models for reranking.

[124] propose a metric that measures both the impact and recency of the retrieved text\\nchunks.

In this stage, suitable generation models must\\nbe selected based on the downstream tasks. The retrieved graph data is then transformed into\\nformats compatible with the generators. The generator takes both the query and the transformed\\ngraph data as inputs to produce the final response.

The organization of this\\nsection and the overview of graph-enhanced generation are depicted in Figure 5.\\n7.1\\nGenerators\\nThe selection of generators often depends on the type of downstream task at hand. For discrimi-\\nnative tasks (e.g., multi-choice question answering) or generative tasks that can be formulated as\\ndiscriminative tasks (e.g., KBQA), one can utilize GNNs or discriminative language models to learn\\nrepresentations of the data. These representations can then be mapped to the logits associated\\nwith different answer options to provide responses. Alternatively, generative language models can\\nbe employed to directly generate answers. For generative tasks, however, the use of GNNs and\\ndiscriminative language models alone is insufficient. These tasks require the generation of text,\\nwhich necessitates the deployment of decoders.\\n7.1.1\\nGNNs.

In the context of integrating LMs with graph data, it is necessary to first\\nconvert the retrieved graph data into specific graph formats. This conversion process ensures\\nthat the structured information is effectively understood and utilized by the LMs. These formats,\\nwhich will be elaborated on in Section 7.2, are crucial for preserving the relational and hierarchical\\nstructure of the graph data, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to interpret complex data types.\\nOnce the graph data is formatted, it is then combined with a query and fed into an LM.\\nFor encoder-only models, such as BERT [28] and RoBERTa [107], their primary use is in discrimi-\\nnative tasks. Similar to GNNs, these models first encode the input text and then utilize MLPs to map\\nit to the answer space [63, 70, 90]. On the other hand, encoder-decoder and decoder-only models,\\nsuch as T5 [138], GPT-4 [127], and LLaMA [31], are adept at both discriminative and generative', 'tasks. These models excel in text understanding, generation, and reasoning, allowing them to\\nprocess textual inputs directly and generate textual responses [32, 73, 75, 112, 119, 154, 164, 171].\\n7.1.3\\nHybrid Models. Considering the strengths of GNNs at representing the structure of graph\\ndata, and the robust understanding of text demonstrated by LMs, many studies are exploring the\\nintegration of these two technologies to generate coherent responses. This paper categorizes the\\nhybrid generative approaches into two distinct types: cascaded paradigm and parallel paradigm.\\n(1) Cascaded Paradigm. In the cascaded approaches, the process involves a sequential interaction\\nwhere the output from one model serves as the input for the next. Specifically, the GNN processes\\nthe graph data first, encapsulating its structural and relational information into a form that the\\nLM can understand. Subsequently, this transformed data is fed into the LM, which then generates\\nthe final text-based response. These methods leverage the strengths of each model in a step-wise\\nfashion, ensuring detailed attention to both structural and textual data.', 'fashion, ensuring detailed attention to both structural and textual data.\\nIn these methods, prompt tuning [88, 91, 105, 106] is a typical approach, where GNNs are\\ncommonly employed to encode the retrieved graph data. The encoded graph data is subsequently\\npre-pended as a prefix to the input text embeddings of an LM. The GNN is then optimized through\\ndownstream tasks to produce enhanced encodings of the graph data [44, 55, 58, 197].\\n(2) Parallel Paradigm. On the other hand, the parallel approach operates by concurrently utilizing\\nthe capabilities of both the GNN and the LLM. In this setup, both models receive the initial inputs\\nsimultaneously and work in tandem to process different facets of the same data.

Publication date: September 2024.', '111:20\\nPeng et al.\\non graph structures. Next, we will introduce five types of graph languages separately: Adjacency /\\nEdge Table, Natural Language, Codes, Syntax Tree, and Node Sequence.\\n(1) Adjacency / Edge Table. The adjacency table and the edge table are widely used methods\\nfor describing graph structures [38, 49, 94, 165]. The adjacency table enumerates the immediate\\nneighbors of each vertex, offering a compact way to represent connections in sparse graphs. For\\nexample, KG-GPT [80] linearizes the triples in the retrieved subgraph, which are then concatenated\\nand fed into the LLMs. Conversely, the edge table details all the edges within the graph, providing\\na straightforward representation that is particularly useful for processing and analyzing graphs in\\na linear format. Both two methods are brief, easy to understand, and intuitive.\\n(2) Natural Language. Given that user queries are typically presented in natural language, and\\nconsidering the outstanding natural language comprehension capabilities of LMs, it becomes a\\ncompelling approach to describe the retrieved graph data using natural language. By translating', 'compelling approach to describe the retrieved graph data using natural language. By translating\\ngraph data into descriptive, easily comprehensible language, LMs can bridge the gap between\\nraw data representation and user-friendly information, facilitating more effective interactions\\nwith data-driven applications. For example, some researchers [63, 90] propose defining a natural\\nlanguage template for each type of edge in advance and subsequently filling in the endpoints of each\\nedge into the corresponding template based on its type. Ye et al. [190] employ natural language to\\ndescribe the information of 1-hop and 2-hop neighboring nodes of the central node. Edge et al. [32]\\nutilize LLMs to generate report-like summaries for each detected graph community. Wu et al. [182]\\nand Guo et al. [50] adopt LMs to rewrite the edge table of retrieved subgraphs, generating a natural\\nlanguage description. Fatemi et al.

[155] integrate\\ninformation from different granularities within the graph into prompts through natural language\\nin the form of dialogue.\\n(3) Code-Like Forms. Considering that natural language descriptions and other 1-D sequences are\\ninherently inadequate for directly representing the 2-D structure of graph data, and given the robust\\ncode comprehension capabilities of LMs, many researchers [49] explore using code-like formats\\nto represent graph structures. For example, Guo et al.

Compared to direct flattening of graphs, some research [201] propose transform-\\ning graphs into structures akin to syntax trees. Syntax trees possess a hierarchical structure and,', 'ing graphs into structures akin to syntax trees. Syntax trees possess a hierarchical structure and,\\nbeing topological graphs, also maintain a topological order.

This\\nformat not only encapsulates structural information but also integrates the features of the nodes. By\\ntraversing this syntax tree, it is possible to obtain a node sequence that maintains both topological\\norder and hierarchical structure.\\n(5) Node Sequence. Some studies [18, 119] propose representing graphs through sequences of\\nnodes, which are often generated using predefined rules. Compared to natural language descriptions,\\nthese node sequences are more concise and incorporate prior knowledge, specifically the structural\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.

[154] transform the retrieved\\npaths into node sequences and input them into an LLM to enhance the task performance. LLaGA [18]\\nproposes two templates that can transform graphs into node sequences. The first template, known\\nas the Neighborhood Detail Template, offers a detailed examination of the central node along with\\nits immediate surroundings. The second, termed the Hop-Field Overview Template, provides a\\nsummarized perspective of a node’s neighborhood, which can be expanded to encompass broader\\nareas. GNN-RAG [119] inputs the retrieved reasoning paths into LMs in the form of node sequences\\nas prompts.\\nDiscussion. Good graph languages should be complete, concise, and comprehensible. Complete-\\nness entails capturing all essential information within the graph structure, ensuring no critical\\ndetails are omitted. Conciseness refers to the necessity of keeping textual descriptions brief to avoid\\nthe “lost in the middle” phenomenon [104] or exceeding the length limitations of LMs. Lengthy', 'the “lost in the middle” phenomenon [104] or exceeding the length limitations of LMs. Lengthy\\ninputs can hinder LMs’ processing capabilities, potentially causing loss of context or truncated data\\ninterpretation. Comprehensibility ensures that the language used is easily understood by LLMs,\\nfacilitating accurate representation of the graph’s structure. Due to the characteristics of different\\ngraph languages, their choice can significantly impact the performance of downstream tasks [38].\\n7.2.2\\nGraph Embeddings. The above graph language methods transform graph data into text\\nsequences, which may result in overly lengthy contexts, incurring high computational costs and\\npotentially exceeding the processing limits of LLMs. Additionally, LLMs currently struggle to fully\\ncomprehend graph structures even with graph languages [49]. Thus, using GNNs to represent\\ngraphs as embeddings presents a promising alternative. The core challenge lies in integrating graph\\nembeddings with textual representations into a unified semantic space. Current research focuses\\non utilizing prompt tuning methodologies, as discussed earlier. There are also some methods that\\nadopt FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder) [65, 194], which first convert the graph data into text, then encode', 'it using an LM-based encoder and input it into the decoders [29, 37, 193]. Notably, feeding graph\\nrepresentations into LMs is feasible primarily with open-source LMs, not closed-source models like\\nGPT-4 [127]. While graph embedding methods avoid handling long text inputs, they face other\\nchallenges, such as difficulty in preserving precise information like specific entity names and poor\\ngeneralization.\\n7.3\\nGeneration Enhancement\\nIn the generation phase, besides converting the retrieved graph data into formats acceptable by the\\ngenerator and inputting it together with the query to generate the final response, many researchers\\nexplore various methods of generation enhancement techniques to improve the quality of output\\nresponses. These methods can be classified into three categories based on their application stages:\\npre-generation enhancement, mid-generation enhancement, and post-generation enhancement.\\n7.3.1\\nPre-Generation Enhancement. Pre-generation enhancement techniques focus on improving\\nthe quality of input data or representations before feeding them into the generator. In fact, there\\nis no clear boundary between Pre-Generation Enhancement and Retrieval. In this survey, we\\ncategorize the retrieval stage as the process of retrieving knowledge from the original graph, and', 'categorize the retrieval stage as the process of retrieving knowledge from the original graph, and\\nmerging and pruning retrieved knowledge. Subsequent operations are considered Pre-Generation\\nEnhancements.\\nCommonly used pre-generation enhancement approaches primarily involve semantically en-\\nriching the retrieved graph data to achieve tighter integration between the graph data and textual\\nquery.

Cheng et al. [20]\\nfirst leverage LLMs to generate a reasoning plan and answer queries according to the plan.\\nTaunk\\net al. [158] and Yasunaga et al. [189] aim to enhance GNNs by enabling them to learn graph\\nrepresentations relevant to queries. They achieve this by extracting all nouns from the QA pairs (or\\nthe QA pairs themselves) and inserting them as nodes into the retrieved subgraph. Mavromatis\\nand Karypis [118] propose a method where, prior to generation, the representation of the query\\nis decomposed into multiple vectors termed “instructions”, each representing different features\\nof the query. These instructions are used as conditions during message passing when applying\\nGNNs to learn from retrieved subgraphs. In addition, there are methods that incorporate additional\\ninformation beyond graph data. For example, PullNet [151] incorporates documents relevant to\\nentities and MVP-Tuning [63] retrieves other related questions.', 'entities and MVP-Tuning [63] retrieves other related questions.\\n7.3.2\\nMid-Generation Enhancement. Mid-generation enhancement involves techniques applied\\nduring the generation process. These methods typically adjust the generation strategies based on\\nintermediate results or contextual cues. TIARA [148] introduces constrained decoding to control\\nthe output space and reduce generation errors. When generating logical forms, if the constrained\\ndecoder detects that it is currently generating a pattern item, it restricts the next generated token\\nto options that exist in tries containing KB classes and relations. Compared with the Beam Search,\\nthis approach ensures that pattern items generated are guaranteed to exist in the knowledge graph,\\nthereby reducing generation errors. There are other methods adjusting the prompts of LLMs to\\nachieve multi-step reasoning. For example, MindMap [175] not only produces answers but also\\ngenerates the reasoning process.\\n7.3.3\\nPost-Generation Enhancement. Post-generation enhancement occurs after the initial response\\nis generated. Post-generation enhancement methods primarily involve integrating multiple gen-\\nerated responses to obtain the final response. Some methods focus on integrating outputs from', 'erated responses to obtain the final response. Some methods focus on integrating outputs from\\nthe same generator under different conditions or inputs. For example, Edge et al. [32] generate a\\nsummary for each graph community, followed by generating responses to queries based on the\\nsummary, and then scoring these responses using an LLM. Ultimately, the responses are sorted in\\ndescending order according to their scores and sequentially incorporated into the prompt until\\nthe token limit is reached. Subsequently, the LLM generates the final response.\\nWang et al.\\n[164] and Kim et al. [80] first decompose the query into several sub-questions, then generate\\nanswers for each sub-question, and finally merge the answers of all sub-questions to obtain the\\nfinal answer. Alternatively, other methods combine or select responses generated by different\\nmodels.\\nLin et al. [97] and Jiang et al. [68] combine the outputs generated by both GNNs and\\nLLMs to reach a synergistic effect. UniOQA [95] explores two methods for generating answers:\\none involves generating queries in Cypher Query Language (CQL) to execute and obtain results,', 'one involves generating queries in Cypher Query Language (CQL) to execute and obtain results,\\nwhile the other method directly generates answers based on retrieved triplets. The final answer is\\ndetermined through a dynamic selection mechanism. In EmbedKGQA [145], besides the learned\\nscoring function, researchers additionally design a rule-based score based on the graph structures.\\nThese two scores are combined to find the answer entity. Li et al. [94] combine answers based on\\nretrieved graph data with responses generated according to the LLM’s own knowledge. In addition\\nto integrating multiple responses, KALMV [7] trains a verifier to judge whether the generated\\nanswer is correct, and if it is not, to further determine whether the error is due to generation or\\nretrieval.\\nJ.

Another group of works adopts generative language models for\\ntraining-free retrieval. Candidate graph elements such as entities, triples, paths, or subgraphs are\\nincluded as part of the prompt input to the LLMs. The LLMs then leverage semantic associations\\nto select appropriate graph elements based on the provided prompt [32, 75, 80, 119, 154, 164, 171].\\nThese methods harness the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LMs to retrieve relevant\\ngraph elements without the need for explicit training.\\n8.1.2', 'graph elements without the need for explicit training.\\n8.1.2\\nTraining-Based. When the retrieval granularity is nodes or triplets, many methods train\\nretrievers to maximize the similarity between the retrieval ground truth and the query. For instance,\\nMemNNs [12] leverages metric learning to closely align the ground truth with the query in semantic\\nspace while differentiating unrelated facts from the query. On the contrary, when the retrieval\\ngranularity is paths, training retrievers often adopts an autoregressive approach, where the previous\\nrelationship path is concatenated to the end of the query. The model then predicts the next relation\\nbased on the concatenated input [50, 182].\\nHowever, the lack of ground truth for retrieval content in the majority of datasets poses a\\nsignificant challenge. To address this issue, many methods attempt to construct reasoning paths\\nbased on distant supervision to guide retriever training. For example,\\nZhang et al. [196] , Feng\\net al. [39] and Luo et al. [112] extract all paths (or shortest paths) between entities in the queries\\nand entities in the answers, using them as training data for the retriever. In addition, Zhang et al.', 'and entities in the answers, using them as training data for the retriever. In addition, Zhang et al.\\n[196] also employ a relationship extraction dataset for distant supervision in unsupervised settings.\\nThere is another category of methods that utilize implicit intermediate supervision signals to train\\nRetrievers. For instance, NSM [54] employs a bidirectional search strategy, where two retrievers start\\nsearching from the head entity and tail entity, respectively. The supervised objective is to ensure\\nthat the paths searched by the two retrievers converge as closely as possible. KnowGPT [198] and\\nMINERVA [23] treat the selection of adjacent nodes to build paths or subgraphs as a Markov process.\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.', '111:24\\nPeng et al.\\nThey design the reward function around the inclusion of the answer in the retrieved information\\nand adopt reinforcement learning methods e.g. policy gradient to optimize the retriever.\\nSome methods argue that distant supervision signals or implicit intermediate supervision signals\\nmay contain considerable noise, making it challenging to train effective retrievers. Therefore, they\\nconsider employing self-supervised methods for pre-training retrievers. SKP [29] pre-trains the\\nDPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) model [78]. Initially, it conducts random sampling on subgraphs\\nand transforms the sampled subgraphs into passages. Subsequently, it randomly masks passages,\\ntrains the model using a Masked Language Model (MLM), and employs contrastive learning by\\ntreating the masked passages and original passages as positive pairs for comparison.\\n8.2\\nTraining of Generator\\n8.2.1\\nTraining-Free. Training-Free Generators primarily cater to closed-source LLMs or scenarios\\nwhere avoiding high training costs is essential. In these methods, the retrieved graph data is fed\\ninto the LLM alongside the query. The LLMs then generate responses based on the task description', 'into the LLM alongside the query. The LLMs then generate responses based on the task description\\nprovided in the prompt, heavily relying on their inherent ability to understand both the query and\\nthe graph data.\\n8.2.2\\nTraining-Based. Training the generator can directly receive supervised signals from down-\\nstream tasks. For generative LLMs, fine-tuning can be achieved using supervised fine-tuning (SFT),\\nwhere task descriptions, queries, and graph data are inputted, and the output is compared against\\nthe ground truth for the downstream task [55, 58, 112]. On the other hand, for GNNs or discrimina-\\ntive models functioning as generators, specialized loss functions tailored to the downstream tasks\\nare employed to train the models effectively [68, 90, 158, 189, 199].\\n8.3\\nJoint Training\\nJointly training retrievers and generators simultaneously enhances performance on downstream\\ntasks by leveraging their complementary strengths. Some approaches unify retrievers and generators\\ninto a single model, typically LLMs, and train them with both retrieval and generation objectives\\nsimultaneously [112]. This method capitalizes on the cohesive capabilities of a unified architecture,', 'simultaneously [112]. This method capitalizes on the cohesive capabilities of a unified architecture,\\nenabling the model to seamlessly retrieve relevant information and generate coherent responses\\nwithin a single framework.\\nOther methodologies involve initially training retrievers and generators separately, followed by\\njoint training techniques to fine-tune both components. For instance, Subgraph Retriever [196]\\nadopts an alternating training paradigm, where the retriever’s parameters are fixed to use the\\ngraph data for training the generator. Subsequently, the generator’s parameters are fixed, and\\nfeedback from the generator is used to guide the retriever’s training. This iterative process helps\\nboth components refine their performance in a coordinated manner.\\n9\\nApplications and Evaluation\\nIn this section, we will summarize the downstream tasks, application domains, benchmarks and\\nmetrics, and industrial applications related to GraphRAG.

The QA tasks specifically include Knowledge Base Question Answering\\n(KBQA) and CommonSense Question Answering (CSQA).\\n(1) KBQA. KBQA serves as a cornerstone downstream task for GraphRAG. In KBQA, questions\\ntypically pertain to specific knowledge graphs, and answers often involve entities, relationships, or\\noperations between sets of entities within the knowledge graph. The task tests the systems’ ability\\nto retrieve and reason over structured knowledge bases, which is crucial in facilitating complex\\nquery responses.', 'to retrieve and reason over structured knowledge bases, which is crucial in facilitating complex\\nquery responses.\\n(2) CSQA. Distinguished from KBQA, CSQA primarily takes the form of multiple-choice questions.\\nCommonsense reasoning typically presents a commonsense question along with several answer\\noptions, each potentially representing either the name of an entity or a statement. The objective\\nis for machines to utilize external commonsense knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet, to find\\nrelevant knowledge pertaining to the question and options, and to engage in appropriate reasoning\\nand derive the correct answer.\\n9.1.2\\nInformation Retrieval. Information Retrieval tasks consist of two categories: Entity Linking\\n(EL) and Relation Extraction (RE).\\n(1) Entity Linking. Entity Linking (EL) is a critical task in the field of natural language processing\\nthat involves identifying entities mentioned in text segments and linking them to their correspond-\\ning entities in a knowledge graph. By leveraging a system such as Graph RAG, it is possible to\\nretrieve relevant information from the knowledge graph, which facilitates the accurate inference of\\nthe specific entities that match the mentions in the text [180].', 'the specific entities that match the mentions in the text [180].\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.', '111:26\\nPeng et al.\\n(2) Relation Extraction. Relation Extraction (RE) aims at identifying and classifying semantic\\nrelationships between entities within a text. GraphRAG can significantly enhance this task by\\nusing graph-based structures to encode and exploit the interdependencies among entities, thus\\nfacilitating more accurate and contextually nuanced extraction of relational data from diverse text\\nsources [94, 154, 155].\\n9.1.3\\nOthers. In addition to the aforementioned downstream tasks, GraphRAG can be applied\\nto various other tasks in the realm of natural language processing such as fact verification, link\\nprediction, dialogue systems, and recommendation.\\n(1) Fact Verification. The fact verification task typically involves assessing the truthfulness of a\\nfactual statement using knowledge graphs. Models are tasked with determining the validity of a\\ngiven factual assertion by leveraging structured knowledge repositories. GraphRAG techniques can\\nbe utilized to extract evidential connections between entities to enhance the system’s efficiency\\nand accuracy [94, 136, 154, 155].\\n(2) Link Prediction. Link prediction involves predicting missing relationships or potential con-', '(2) Link Prediction. Link prediction involves predicting missing relationships or potential con-\\nnections between entities in a graph. GraphRAG is applied to this task [22, 129] by leveraging its\\nability to retrieve and analyze structured information from graphs, enhancing prediction accuracy\\nby uncovering latent relationships and patterns within the graph data.\\n(3) Dialogue Systems. Dialogue Systems is designed to converse with humans using natural\\nlanguage, handling various tasks such as answering questions, providing information, or facilitating\\nuser interactions. By structuring conversation histories and contextual relationships in a graph-\\nbased framework, GraphRAG systems [5] can improve the model’s ability to generate coherent and\\ncontextually relevant responses.\\n(4) Recommendation. In the context of E-commerce platforms, the purchase relationships between\\nusers and products naturally form a network graph. The primary objective of recommendation\\nwithin these platforms is to predict the future purchasing intentions of users, effectively forecasting\\nthe potential connections within this graph [168].\\n9.2\\nApplication Domains\\nGraphRAG is widely applied in E-commerce and biomedical, academic, literature, legal, and other\\napplication scenarios for its outstanding ability to integrate structured knowledge graphs with', 'application scenarios for its outstanding ability to integrate structured knowledge graphs with\\nnatural language processing, which will be introduced below.\\n9.2.1\\nE-Commerce. The primary goal in the E-commerce area involves improving customer shop-\\nping experiences and increasing sales through personalized recommendations and intelligent\\ncustomer services. In this area, historical interactions between users and products can naturally\\nform a graph, which implicitly encapsulates users’ behavioral patterns and preference information.\\nHowever, due to the increasing number of E-commerce platforms and the growing volume of user\\ninteraction data, using GraphRAG technology to extract key subgraphs is crucial. Wang et al.\\n[168] ensemble multiple retrievers under different types or with different parameters to extract\\nrelevant subgraphs, which are then encoded for temporal user action prediction. To improve the\\nmodel performance of customer service question answering systems, Xu et al. [183] construct\\na past-issue graph with intra-issue and inter-issue relations. For each given query, subgraphs of\\nsimilar past issues are retrieved to enhance the system’s response quality.\\n9.2.2\\nBiomedical.

Additionally, some approaches propose rewriting model\\ninputs using retrieved information to enhance generation effectiveness [89].\\n9.2.3\\nAcademic. In the academic research domain, each paper is authored by one or more re-\\nsearchers and is associated with a field of study. Authors are affiliated with institutions, and there\\nexist relationships among authors, such as collaboration or shared institutional affiliations. These\\nelements can be structured into a graph format.

Similar to academic research, a knowledge graph can be constructed in the realm\\nof literature, with nodes representing books, authors, publishers, and series, and edges labeled\\n“written-by”, “published-in”, and “book-series”. GraphRAG can be utilized to enhance realistic\\napplications like smart libraries.\\n9.2.5\\nLegal. In legal contexts, extensive citation connections exist between cases and judicial\\nopinions, as judges frequently reference previous opinions when making new decisions. This\\nnaturally creates a structured graph where nodes represent opinions, opinion clusters, dockets, and\\ncourts, and edges encompass relationships such as “opinion-citation”, “opinion-cluster”, “cluster-\\ndocket”, and “docket-court”. The application of GraphRAG in legal scenarios could aid lawyers and\\nlegal researchers in various tasks such as case analysis and legal consultation.\\n9.2.6\\nOthers. In addition to the above applications, GraphRAG is also applied to other real-world\\nscenarios such as intelligence report generation [139], patent phrase similarity detection [133] and', 'scenarios such as intelligence report generation [139], patent phrase similarity detection [133] and\\nsoftware understanding [1]. Ranade and Joshi [139] first construct an Event Plot Graph (EPG)\\nand retrieve the critical aspects of the events to aid the generation of intelligence reports. Peng\\nand Yang [133] create a patent-phrase graph and retrieve the ego network of the given patent\\nphrase to assist the judgment of phrase similarity. Alhanahnah et al.

The benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of the GraphRAG system\\ncan be divided into two categories. The first category is the corresponding datasets of downstream\\ntasks.

He et al. [55] propose a flexible question-answering benchmark targeting\\nreal-world textual graphs, named GraphQA, which is applicable to multiple applications including\\nscene graph understanding, commonsense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning.

CRAG [186] provides a structured query dataset, with additional mock APIs to\\naccess information from underlying mock KGs to achieve fair comparison.\\n9.3.2\\nMetrics. The evaluation metrics for GraphRAG can be broadly categorized into two main\\ntypes: downstream task evaluation (generation quality) and retrieval quality.\\n(1) Downstream Task Evaluation (Generation Quality). In the majority of research studies, down-\\nstream task evaluation metrics serve as the primary method for assessing GraphRAG’s performance.\\nFor example, in KBQA, Exact Match (EM) and F1 score are commonly used to measure the accuracy\\nof answering entities. In addition, many researchers utilize BERT4Score and GPT4Score to mitigate\\ninstances where LLMs generate entities that are synonymous with the ground truth but not exact\\nmatches. In CSQA, Accuracy is the most commonly used evaluation metric. For generative tasks\\nsuch as QA systems, metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and others are commonly employed', 'such as QA systems, metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and others are commonly employed\\nto assess the quality of the text generated by the model.\\n(2) Retrieval Quality Evaluation. While evaluating GraphRAG based on downstream task perfor-\\nmance is feasible, directly measuring the accuracy of retrieved content poses challenges. Therefore,\\nmany studies employ specific metrics to gauge the precision of retrieved content. For instance,\\nwhen ground truth entities are available, retrieval systems face a balance between the quantity of\\nretrieved information and the coverage of answers. Hence, some studies utilize the ratio between\\nanswer coverage and the size of the retrieval subgraph to evaluate the performance of the retrieval\\nsystem. In addition, several studies have explored metrics such as query relevance, diversity, and\\nfaithfulness score to respectively assess the similarity between retrieved content and queries, the\\ndiversity of retrieved content, and the faithfulness of the information retrieved.\\n9.4\\nGraphRAG in Industry\\nIn this section, we mainly focus on industrial GraphRAG systems.

Developing\\nefficient methods for dynamic updates and real-time integration of new data will significantly\\nenhance the effectiveness and relevance of GraphRAG systems.\\n10.2\\nMulti-Modality Information Integration\\nMost knowledge graphs primarily encompass textual information, thereby lacking the inclusion of\\nother modalities such as images, audio, and videos, which hold the potential to significantly enhance\\nthe overall quality and richness of the database [174]. The incorporation of these diverse modalities\\ncould provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the stored knowledge. However,', 'could provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the stored knowledge. However,\\nthe integration of such multi-modal data presents considerable challenges.

However, most contemporary methods are tailored for\\nsmall-scale knowledge graphs [32], which may only comprise thousands of entities. Efficiently and\\neffectively retrieving pertinent entities within large-scale knowledge graphs remains a practical\\nand significant challenge.
