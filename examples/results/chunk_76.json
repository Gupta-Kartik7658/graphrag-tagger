  "chunk": "the “lost in the middle” phenomenon [104] or exceeding the length limitations of LMs. Lengthy inputs can hinder LMs’ processing capabilities, potentially causing loss of context or truncated data interpretation. Comprehensibility ensures that the language used is easily understood by LLMs, facilitating accurate representation of the graph’s structure. Due to the characteristics of different graph languages, their choice can significantly impact the performance of downstream tasks [38].\n7.2.2\nGraph Embeddings. The above graph language methods transform graph data into text sequences, which may result in overly lengthy contexts, incurring high computational costs and potentially exceeding the processing limits of LLMs. Additionally, LLMs currently struggle to fully comprehend graph structures even with graph languages [49]. Thus, using GNNs to represent graphs as embeddings presents a promising alternative. The core challenge lies in integrating graph embeddings with textual representations into a unified semantic space. Current research focuses on utilizing prompt tuning methodologies, as discussed earlier. There are also some methods that adopt FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder) [65, 194], which first convert the graph data into text, then encode",
