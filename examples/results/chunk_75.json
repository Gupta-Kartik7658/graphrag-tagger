[154] transform the retrieved paths into node sequences and input them into an LLM to enhance the task performance. LLaGA [18] proposes two templates that can transform graphs into node sequences. The first template, known as the Neighborhood Detail Template, offers a detailed examination of the central node along with its immediate surroundings. The second, termed the Hop-Field Overview Template, provides a summarized perspective of a node’s neighborhood, which can be expanded to encompass broader areas. GNN-RAG [119] inputs the retrieved reasoning paths into LMs in the form of node sequences as prompts.\nDiscussion. Good graph languages should be complete, concise, and comprehensible. Completeness entails capturing all essential information within the graph structure, ensuring no critical details are omitted. Conciseness refers to the necessity of keeping textual descriptions brief to avoid the “lost in the middle” phenomenon [104] or exceeding the length limitations of LMs. Lengthy",
