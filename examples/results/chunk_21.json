  "chunk": "Language Models\nLanguage models (LMs) excel in language understanding and are mainly classified into two types: discriminative and generative. Discriminative models, like BERT [28], RoBERTa [107] and SentenceBERT [140], focus on estimating the conditional probability ùëÉ(y|x) and are effective in tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. In contrast, generative models, including GPT-3 [14] and\nGPT-4 [127], aim to model the joint probability ùëÉ(x, y) for tasks like machine translation and text generation. These generative pre-trained models have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) by leveraging massive datasets and billions of parameters, contributing to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) with outstanding performance across various tasks.\nIn the early stages, RAG and GraphRAG focused on improving pre-training techniques for discriminative language models [28, 107, 140]. Recently, LLMs such as ChatGPT [128], LLaMA [31], and Qwen2 [184] have shown great potential in language understanding, demonstrating powerful",
