These models excel in text understanding, generation, and reasoning, allowing them to process textual inputs directly and generate textual responses [32, 73, 75, 112, 119, 154, 164, 171].\n7.1.3\nHybrid Models. Considering the strengths of GNNs at representing the structure of graph data, and the robust understanding of text demonstrated by LMs, many studies are exploring the integration of these two technologies to generate coherent responses. This paper categorizes the hybrid generative approaches into two distinct types: cascaded paradigm and parallel paradigm.\n(1) Cascaded Paradigm. In the cascaded approaches, the process involves a sequential interaction where the output from one model serves as the input for the next. Specifically, the GNN processes the graph data first, encapsulating its structural and relational information into a form that the\nLM can understand. Subsequently, this transformed data is fed into the LM, which then generates the final text-based response. These methods leverage the strengths of each model in a step-wise fashion, ensuring detailed attention to both structural and textual data.",
