Deploying these models to enhance the current GraphRAG pipeline is an essential problem. The input data for graph foundation models is inherently graphstructured, enabling them to handle such data more efficiently than LLM models. Integrating these advanced models into the GraphRAG framework could greatly improve the systemâ€™s ability to process and utilize graph-structured information, thereby enhancing overall performance and capability.\n10.5\nLossless Compression of Retrieved Context\nIn GraphRAG, the retrieved information is organized into a graph structure containing entities and their interrelations. This information is then transformed into a sequence that can be understood by LLMs, resulting in a very long context. There are two issues with inputting such long contexts:\nLLMs cannot handle very long sequences, and extensive computation during inference can be a hindrance for individuals. To address these problems, lossless compression of long contexts is crucial.\nThis approach removes redundant information and compresses lengthy sentences into shorter, yet",
