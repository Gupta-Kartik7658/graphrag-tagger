Furthermore, He et al.\n[55] convert triplet-format and JSON files from ExplaGraphs and SceneGraphs into a standard graph format and selects questions requiring 2-hop reasoning from WebQSP to create the universal graph-format dataset GraphQA for evaluating GraphRAG systems.\n5.1.2\nSelf-Constructed Graph Data. Self-Constructed Graph Data facilitates the customization and integration of proprietary or domain-specific knowledge into the retrieval process. For downstream tasks that do not inherently involve graph data, researchers often propose constructing a graph from multiple sources (e.g., documents, tables, and other databases) and leveraging GraphRAG to enhance task performance. Generally, these self-constructed graphs are closely tied to the specific design of the method, distinguishing them from the open-domain graph data previously mentioned.\nTo model the structural relationships between the documents, Munikoti et al. [124] propose to construct a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple document-level relations, including co-citation, co-topic, co-venue, etc.",
