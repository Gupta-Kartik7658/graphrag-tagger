  "chunk": "methods propose hybrid retrieval approaches to improve both retrieval efficiency and accuracy.\nMany approaches adopt a multi-stage retrieval strategy, employing different models at each stage.\nFor example, RoG [112] first utilizes LLMs to generate planning paths and then extracts paths satisfying the planning paths from knowledge graphs. GenTKGQA [44] infers crucial relations and constraints from the query using LLMs and extracts triplets according to these constraints.\n6.2\nRetrieval Paradigm\nWithin GraphRAG, different retrieval paradigms, including once retrieval, iterative retrieval, and multi-stage retrieval, play crucial roles in improving the relevance and depth of the retrieved information. Once retrieval aims to gather all pertinent information in a single operation. Iterative retrieval conducts further searches based on previously retrieved information, progressively narrowing down to the most relevant results. Here we further divide iterative retrieval into adaptive retrieval and non-adaptive retrieval, with the only difference lying in whether the stopping of the retrieval is determined by the model. Another retrieval paradigm is multi-stage retrieval, where retrieval is divided into multiple stages. Different types of retrievers may be employed at each stage",
