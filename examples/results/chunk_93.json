GraphRAG can significantly enhance this task by using graph-based structures to encode and exploit the interdependencies among entities, thus facilitating more accurate and contextually nuanced extraction of relational data from diverse text sources [94, 154, 155].\n9.1.3\nOthers. In addition to the aforementioned downstream tasks, GraphRAG can be applied to various other tasks in the realm of natural language processing such as fact verification, link prediction, dialogue systems, and recommendation.\n(1) Fact Verification. The fact verification task typically involves assessing the truthfulness of a factual statement using knowledge graphs. Models are tasked with determining the validity of a given factual assertion by leveraging structured knowledge repositories. GraphRAG techniques can be utilized to extract evidential connections between entities to enhance the systemâ€™s efficiency and accuracy [94, 136, 154, 155].\n(2) Link Prediction. Link prediction involves predicting missing relationships or potential con-",
