For instance, [22, 80] breaks down the primary question into subsentences, each representing a distinct relation, and sequentially retrieves the pertinent triplets for each sub-sentence.\n6.4.2\nKnowledge Enhancement. After retrieving initial results, knowledge enhancement strategies are employed to refine and improve the retriever‚Äôs results. This phase often involves knowledge merging and knowledge pruning processes to present the most pertinent information prominently.\nThese techniques aim to ensure that the final set of retrieved results is not only comprehensive but also highly relevant to the user‚Äôs information needs.\n(1) Knowledge Merging. Knowledge merging retrieved information enables compression and aggregation of information, which assists in obtaining a more comprehensive view by consolidating relevant details from multiple sources. This approach not only enhances the completeness and coherence of the information but also mitigates issues related to input length constraints in models.\nKnowledgeNavigator [50] merges nodes and condenses the retrieved sub-graph through triple aggregation to enhance the reasoning efficiency. In Subgraph Retrieval [196], after retrieving top-ùëò paths from each topic entity to form a single subgraph, researchers propose to merge the same",
