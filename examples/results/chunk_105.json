In the generation phase, the retrieved subgraph data is formatted into text and submitted along with the context and query for processing by LLMs.\n• NallM (by Neo4j)15: The NaLLM (Neo4j and Large Language Models) framework integrates\nNeo4j graph database technology with LLMs. It aims to explore and demonstrate the synergy between Neo4j and LLMs, focusing on three primary use cases: Natural Language Interface to a\nKnowledge Graph, Creating a Knowledge Graph from Unstructured Data, and Generate Reports\nUsing Both Static Data and LLM Data.\n• LLM Graph Builder (by Neo4j)16: It is a project developed by Neo4j for automatically constructing knowledge graphs, suitable for the GraphRAG’s Graph Database Construction and Indexing phase. The project primarily utilizes LLMs to extract nodes, relationships, and their properties from unstructured data, and utilizes the LangChain framework to create structured knowledge graphs.\n10\nFuture Prospects\nWhile GraphRAG technology has made substantial strides, it continues to face enduring challenges",
