  "chunk": "entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based\nIndexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field. In order to track recent progress in this field, we set up a repository at https://github.com/pengboci/GraphRAG-Survey.\nCCS Concepts: • Computing methodologies →Knowledge representation and reasoning; • Information systems →Information retrieval; Data mining.\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Large Language Models, Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Knowl-",
