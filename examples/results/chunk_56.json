[20] adopt SPARQL to get all the aliases of the query entities from Wikidata to augment the retrieval queries, which capture lexical variations of the same entity. Huang et al. [63] propose a consensus-view knowledge retrieval method to improve retrieval accuracy, which first discover semantically relevant queries, and then re-weight the original query terms to enhance the retrieval performance. HyKGE [73] utilizes a large model to generate the hypothesis output of the question, concatenating the hypothesis output with the query as input to the retriever. Golden-Retriever [2] first recognizes the jargon in the query and then retrieves explanations of the jargon as a supplement to the query.\n(2) Query Decomposition. Query decomposition techniques break down or decompose the original user query into smaller, more specific sub-queries. Each sub-query typically focuses on a particular aspect or component of the original query, which successfully alleviates the complexity and ambiguity of language queries. For instance, [22, 80] breaks down the primary question into sub-",
