The project can also utilize open-source RAG toolkits for rapid implementation, such as LlamaIndex11, LangChain12, etc.\n• GraphRAG (by NebulaGraph)13: The project is the first industrial GraphRAG system, which is developed by NebulaGraph Corporation. The project integrates LLMs into the NebulaGraph database, which aims to deliver more intelligent and precise search results.\n• GraphRAG (by Antgroup)14: The framework is developed on the foundation of several AI engineering frameworks such as DB-GPT, knowledge graph engine OpenSPG, and graph database\nTuGraph. Specifically, the system begins by extracting triples from documents using LLMs, which are then stored in the graph database. During the retrieval phase, it identifies keywords from the",
