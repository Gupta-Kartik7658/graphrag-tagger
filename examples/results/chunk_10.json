  "chunk": "begin by introducing the GraphRAG workflow, along with the foundational background knowledge that underpins the field. Then, we categorize the literature according to the primary stages of the\nGraphRAG process: Graph-Based Indexing (G-Indexing), Graph-Guided Retrieval (G-Retrieval), and Graph-Enhanced Generation (G-Generation) in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 respectively, detailing the core technologies and training methods within each phase. Furthermore, we investigate downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of\nGraphRAG. This exploration elucidates how GraphRAG is being utilized in practical settings and reflects its versatility and adaptability across various sectors. Finally, acknowledging that research in GraphRAG is still in its early stages, we delve into potential future research directions. This prognostic discussion aims to pave the way for forthcoming studies, inspire new lines of inquiry, and catalyze progress within the field, ultimately propelling GraphRAG toward more mature and innovative horizons.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:",
