These methods typically adjust the generation strategies based on intermediate results or contextual cues. TIARA [148] introduces constrained decoding to control the output space and reduce generation errors. When generating logical forms, if the constrained decoder detects that it is currently generating a pattern item, it restricts the next generated token to options that exist in tries containing KB classes and relations. Compared with the Beam Search, this approach ensures that pattern items generated are guaranteed to exist in the knowledge graph, thereby reducing generation errors. There are other methods adjusting the prompts of LLMs to achieve multi-step reasoning. For example, MindMap [175] not only produces answers but also generates the reasoning process.\n7.3.3\nPost-Generation Enhancement. Post-generation enhancement occurs after the initial response is generated. Post-generation enhancement methods primarily involve integrating multiple generated responses to obtain the final response. Some methods focus on integrating outputs from",
