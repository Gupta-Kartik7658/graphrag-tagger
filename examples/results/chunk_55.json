Although other techniques such as query rewriting [114, 117, 132, 137] are commonly used in RAG, they are less frequently applied in GraphRAG. We do not delve into these methods, despite their potential adaptation for GraphRAG.\n6.4.1\nQuery Enhancement. Strategies applied to queries typically involve pre-processing techniques that enrich the information for better retrieval. This may include query expansion and query decomposition.\n(1) Query Expansion. Due to the generally short length of queries and their limited information content, query expansion aims to improve search results by supplementing or refining the original query with additional relevant terms or concepts.
