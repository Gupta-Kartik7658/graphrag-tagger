While evaluating GraphRAG based on downstream task performance is feasible, directly measuring the accuracy of retrieved content poses challenges. Therefore, many studies employ specific metrics to gauge the precision of retrieved content. For instance, when ground truth entities are available, retrieval systems face a balance between the quantity of retrieved information and the coverage of answers. Hence, some studies utilize the ratio between answer coverage and the size of the retrieval subgraph to evaluate the performance of the retrieval system. In addition, several studies have explored metrics such as query relevance, diversity, and faithfulness score to respectively assess the similarity between retrieved content and queries, the diversity of retrieved content, and the faithfulness of the information retrieved.\n9.4\nGraphRAG in Industry\nIn this section, we mainly focus on industrial GraphRAG systems. These systems are characterized by their reliance on industrial graph database systems or their focus on large-scale graph data, details of which are as follows.",
