  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 111:9 is a semantic network built from nodes representing words or phrases connected by edges denoting semantic relationships. ATOMIC [64, 142] models the causal relationships between events.\n(2) Domain Knowledge Graphs. As discussed in Section 1, domain-specific knowledge graphs are crucial for enhancing LLMs in addressing domain-specific questions. These KGs offer specialized knowledge in particular fields, aiding models in gaining deeper insights and a more comprehensive understanding of complex professional relationships. In the biomedical field, CMeKG6 encompasses a wide range of data, including diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, and relationships between medical concepts. CPubMed-KG7 is a medical knowledge database in Chinese, building on the extensive repository of biomedical literature in PubMed. In the movie domain, Wiki-Movies [121] extracts structured information from Wikipedia articles related to films, compiling data about movies, actors, directors, genres, and other relevant details into a structured format. Additionally, Jin et al. [75] construct a dataset named GR-Bench, which includes five domain knowledge graphs",
