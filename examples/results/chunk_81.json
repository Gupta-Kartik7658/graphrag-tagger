[32] generate a summary for each graph community, followed by generating responses to queries based on the summary, and then scoring these responses using an LLM. Ultimately, the responses are sorted in descending order according to their scores and sequentially incorporated into the prompt until the token limit is reached. Subsequently, the LLM generates the final response.\nWang et al.\n[164] and Kim et al. [80] first decompose the query into several sub-questions, then generate answers for each sub-question, and finally merge the answers of all sub-questions to obtain the final answer. Alternatively, other methods combine or select responses generated by different models.\nLin et al. [97] and Jiang et al. [68] combine the outputs generated by both GNNs and\nLLMs to reach a synergistic effect. UniOQA [95] explores two methods for generating answers: one involves generating queries in Cypher Query Language (CQL) to execute and obtain results,",
