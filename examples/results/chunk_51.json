[182] and Guo et al.\n[50] first utilizes the model to generate faithful reasoning plans and then retrieves relevant paths based on these plans. GNN-RAG [119] first identifies the entities in the question. Subsequently, all paths between entities that satisfy a certain length relationship are extracted.\n6.3.4\nSubgraphs. Retrieving subgraphs offers significant advantages due to its ability to capture comprehensive relational contexts within a graph. This granularity enables GraphRAG to extract and analyze complex patterns, sequences, and dependencies embedded within larger structures, facilitating deeper insights and a more nuanced understanding of semantic connections.\nTo ensure both information completeness and retrieval efficiency, some methods propose an initial rule-based approach to retrieve candidate subgraphs, which are subsequently refined or processed further. Peng and Yang [133] retrieve the ego graph of the patent phrase from the self-constructed patent-phrase graph.\nYasunaga et al. [189] , Feng et al. [40] and Taunk et al.",
