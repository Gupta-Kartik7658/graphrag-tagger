  "chunk": ", e(𝑙−1) 𝑖,𝑗 )), (1) where N(𝑖) represents the neighbors of node 𝑖. MSG denotes the message function, which computes the message based on the node, its neighbor, and the edge between them. AGG refers to the aggregation function that combines the received messages using a permutation-invariant method, such as mean, sum, or max. UPD represents the update function, which updates each node’s attributes with the aggregated messages.\nSubsequently, a readout function, e.g., mean, sum, or max pooling, can be applied to obtain the global-level representation: h𝐺= READOUT𝑖∈V𝐺(h(𝐿) 𝑖 ).\n(2)\nIn GraphRAG, GNNs can be utilized to obtain representations of graph data for the retrieval phase, as well as to model the retrieved graph structures.\n3.3\nLanguage Models\nLanguage models (LMs) excel in language understanding and are mainly classified into two types:",
