  "chunk": "could provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the stored knowledge. However, the integration of such multi-modal data presents considerable challenges. As the volume of information increases, the graphâ€™s complexity and size grow exponentially, rendering it increasingly difficult to manage and maintain. This escalation in scale necessitates the development of advanced methodologies and sophisticated tools to efficiently handle and seamlessly integrate the diverse data types into the existing graph structure, ensuring both the accuracy and accessibility of the enriched knowledge graph.\n10.3\nScalable and Efficient Retrieval Mechanisms\nKnowledge graphs in the industrial setting may encompass millions or even billions of entities, representing a vast and intricate scale. However, most contemporary methods are tailored for small-scale knowledge graphs [32], which may only comprise thousands of entities. Efficiently and effectively retrieving pertinent entities within large-scale knowledge graphs remains a practical and significant challenge. Developing advanced retrieval algorithms and scalable infrastructure is essential to address this issue, ensuring that the system can manage the extensive data volume while maintaining high performance and accuracy in entity retrieval.\n15https://github.com/neo4j/NaLLM 16https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder",
