  "chunk": "one involves generating queries in Cypher Query Language (CQL) to execute and obtain results, while the other method directly generates answers based on retrieved triplets. The final answer is determined through a dynamic selection mechanism. In EmbedKGQA [145], besides the learned scoring function, researchers additionally design a rule-based score based on the graph structures.\nThese two scores are combined to find the answer entity. Li et al. [94] combine answers based on retrieved graph data with responses generated according to the LLMâ€™s own knowledge. In addition to integrating multiple responses, KALMV [7] trains a verifier to judge whether the generated answer is correct, and if it is not, to further determine whether the error is due to generation or retrieval.\nJ.
