  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 111:5 provide a structured synthesis of current RAG methodologies, fostering a deeper understanding and suggesting future directions of the area.\nFrom a broad perspective, GraphRAG can be seen as a branch of RAG, which retrieves relevant relational knowledge from graph databases instead of text corpus. However, compared to textbased RAG, GraphRAG takes into account the relationships between texts and incorporates the structural information as additional knowledge beyond text. Furthermore, during the construction of graph data, raw text data may undergo filtering and summarization processes, enhancing the refinement of information within the graph data. Although previous surveys on RAG have touched upon GraphRAG, they predominantly center on textual data integration. This paper diverges by placing a primary emphasis on the indexing, retrieval, and utilization of structured graph data, which represents a substantial departure from handling purely textual information and spurs the emergence of many new techniques.\n2.2\nLLMs on Graphs\nLLMs are revolutionizing natural language processing due to their excellent text understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities, along with their generalization and zero-shot transfer",
