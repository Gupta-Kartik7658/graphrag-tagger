  "chunk": "retrieval is divided into multiple stages. Different types of retrievers may be employed at each stage for more precise and diversified search results. Below, we will provide a detailed introduction to these types of retrieval paradigms.\n6.2.1\nOnce Retrieval. Once retrieval aims to retrieve all the relevant information in a single query.\nOne category of approaches [51, 58, 90] utilize embedding similarities to retrieve the most relevant pieces of information. Another category of methods design pre-defined rules or patterns to directly extract specific structured information such as triplets, paths or subgraphs from graph databases.\nFor example, G-Retriever [55] utilizes an extended PCST algorithm to retrieve the most relevant subgraph. KagNet [97] extracts paths between all pairs of topic entities with lengths not exceeding ùëò.\nYasunaga et al. [189] and Taunk et al. [158] extract the subgraph that contains all topic entities along with their 2-hop neighbors.\nFurthermore, in this subsection, we also include some multiple retrieval methods that involve decoupled and independent retrievals, allowing them to be computed in parallel and executed only",
