Some researchers [26, 89, 177] construct KGs for specific task scenarios, while others [73, 175, 185] utilize open-source knowledge graphs such as CMeKG and CPubMed-KG as retrieval sources. Existing methods generally begin with nonparametric retrievers for initial search, followed by designing methods to filter retrieved content through re-ranking [26, 73, 89, 175, 185]. Additionally, some approaches propose rewriting model inputs using retrieved information to enhance generation effectiveness [89].\n9.2.3\nAcademic. In the academic research domain, each paper is authored by one or more researchers and is associated with a field of study. Authors are affiliated with institutions, and there exist relationships among authors, such as collaboration or shared institutional affiliations. These elements can be structured into a graph format. Utilizing GraphRAG on this graph can facilitate academic exploration, including predicting potential collaborators for an author, identifying trends",
