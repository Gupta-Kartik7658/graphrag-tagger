  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 111:7 4\nOverview of GraphRAG\nGraphRAG is a framework that leverages external structured knowledge graphs to improve contextual understanding of LMs and generate more informed responses, as depicted in Figure 2. The goal of GraphRAG is to retrieve the most relevant knowledge from databases, thereby enhancing the answers of downstream tasks. The process can be defined as 𝑎∗= arg max 𝑎∈𝐴𝑝(𝑎|𝑞, G), (3) where 𝑎∗is the optimal answer of the query 𝑞given the TAG G, and 𝐴is the set of possible responses. After that, we jointly model the target distribution 𝑝(𝑎|𝑞, G) with a graph retriever 𝑝𝜃(𝐺|𝑞, G) and an answer generator 𝑝𝜙(𝑎|𝑞,𝐺) where 𝜃,𝜙are learnable parameters, and utilize the",
