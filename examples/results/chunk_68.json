Given the retrieved subgraph on the left part, we show how to transform it into adjacency/edge table, natural language, node sequence, code-like forms and syntax trees to adapt the input form requirements of different generators.\nthe graph representations derived from GNNs and the text representations generated by LMs using attention mechanisms.\nYasunaga et al. [189] , Munikoti et al. [124] and Taunk et al. [158] directly concatenate graph representations with text representations.\nAnother approach involves designing dedicated modules that integrate GNNs with LMs, enabling the resulting representations to encapsulate both structural and textual information. For instance,\nZhang et al. [199] introduce a module called the GreaseLM Layer, which incorporates both GNN and",
