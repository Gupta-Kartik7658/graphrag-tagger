  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 111:13 survey, we further classify iterative retrieval into two categories: (1) non-adaptive and (2) adaptive retrieval. We provide a detailed summary of these two categories of methods below.\n(1) Non-Adaptive Retrieval. Non-adaptive methods typically follow a fixed sequence of retrieval, and the termination of retrieval is determined by setting a maximum time or a threshold. For example, PullNet [151] retrieves problem-relevant subgraphs throughùëáiterations. In each iteration, the paper designs a retrieval rule to select a subset of retrieved entities, and then expands these entities by searching relevant edges in the knowledge graph. In each iteration, KGP [172] first selects seed nodes based on the similarity between the context and the nodes in the graph. It then uses LLMs to summarize and update the context of the neighboring nodes of the seed nodes, which is utilized in the subsequent iteration.\n(2) Adaptive Retrieval. One distinctive characteristic of adaptive retrieval is to let models autonomously determine the optimal moments to finish the retrieval activities. For instance, [50, 182]",
