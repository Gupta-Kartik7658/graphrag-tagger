These gaps can lead to a phenomenon known as “hallucination” [61] where the model generates inaccurate or even fabricated information. Consequently, it is imperative to supplement LLMs with external knowledge to mitigate this problem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [34, 45, 59, 62, 178, 195, 202] emerged as a significant evolution, which aims to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content by integrating a retrieval component within the generation process. The essence of RAG lies in its ability to dynamically query a large text corpus to incorporate relevant factual knowledge into the responses generated by the underlying language models. This integration not only enriches the contextual depth of the responses but also ensures a higher degree of factual accuracy and specificity. RAG has gained widespread attention due to its exceptional performance and broad",
