GNN-based retrievers typically encode graph data and subsequently score different retrieval granularities based on their similarity to the query. For example, GNN-RAG [119] first encodes the graph, assigns a score to each entity, and retrieves entities relevant to the query based on a threshold. EtD [99] iterates multiple times to retrieve relevant paths. During each iteration, it first uses LLaMA2 [160] to select edges connecting the current node, then employs GNNs to obtain embeddings of the new layer of nodes for the next round of LLM selection.\n6.1.4\nDiscussion. During the retrieval process, non-parametric retrievers exhibit good retrieval efficiency, but they may suffer from inaccurate retrieval due to a lack of training on downstream tasks. Meanwhile, although LM-based retrievers and GNN-based retrievers offer higher retrieval accuracy, they require significant computational overhead. Considering this complementarity, many methods propose hybrid retrieval approaches to improve both retrieval efficiency and accuracy.",
