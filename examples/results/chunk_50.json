  "chunk": "Paths. The retrieval of path-granularity data can be seen as capturing sequences of relationships between entities, enhancing contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. In\nGraphRAG, retrieving paths offers distinct advantages due to their ability to capture complex relationships and contextual dependencies within a graph.\nHowever, path retrieval can be challenging due to the exponential growth in possible paths as graph size increases, which escalates computational complexity. To address this, some methods retrieve relevant paths based on pre-defined rules. For example,\nWang et al. [171] and Lo and\nLim [108] first select entity pairs in the query and then traverse to find all the paths between them within ùëõ-hop. HyKGE [73] first defines three types of paths: path, co-ancestor chain, and co-occurrence chain, and then utilizes corresponding rules to retrieve each of these three types of paths. In addition, some methods utilize models to perform path searching on graphs. ToG [113, 154] proposes to prompt the LLM agent to perform the beam search on KGs and find multiple possible reasoning paths that help answer the question.",
