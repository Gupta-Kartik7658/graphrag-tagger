Comparision between Direct LLM, RAG, and GraphRAG. Given a user query, direct answering by\nLLMs may suffer from shallow responses or lack of specificity. RAG addresses this by retrieving relevant textual information, somewhat alleviating the issue. However, due to the text’s length and flexible natural language expressions of entity relationships, RAG struggles to emphasize “influence” relations, which is the core of the question. While, GraphRAG methods leverage explicit entity and relationship representations in graph data, enabling precise answers by retrieving relevant structured information.\nIn this paper, we are the first to provide a systematic survey of GraphRAG. Specifically, we begin by introducing the GraphRAG workflow, along with the foundational background knowledge",
