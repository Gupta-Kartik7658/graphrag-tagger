  "chunk": "enhancement techniques can further improve the output by intensifying the interaction between the query and the graph data and enriching the content generation itself. The organization of this section and the overview of graph-enhanced generation are depicted in Figure 5.\n7.1\nGenerators\nThe selection of generators often depends on the type of downstream task at hand. For discriminative tasks (e.g., multi-choice question answering) or generative tasks that can be formulated as discriminative tasks (e.g., KBQA), one can utilize GNNs or discriminative language models to learn representations of the data. These representations can then be mapped to the logits associated with different answer options to provide responses. Alternatively, generative language models can be employed to directly generate answers. For generative tasks, however, the use of GNNs and discriminative language models alone is insufficient. These tasks require the generation of text, which necessitates the deployment of decoders.\n7.1.1\nGNNs. Due to the powerful representational capabilities of GNNs for graph data, they are particularly effective for discriminative tasks. GNNs can directly encode graph data, capturing",
