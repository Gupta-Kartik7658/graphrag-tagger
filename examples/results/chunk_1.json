By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as “hallucination”, lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural",
