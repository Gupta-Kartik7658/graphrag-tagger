  "chunk": "(2) Link Prediction. Link prediction involves predicting missing relationships or potential connections between entities in a graph. GraphRAG is applied to this task [22, 129] by leveraging its ability to retrieve and analyze structured information from graphs, enhancing prediction accuracy by uncovering latent relationships and patterns within the graph data.\n(3) Dialogue Systems. Dialogue Systems is designed to converse with humans using natural language, handling various tasks such as answering questions, providing information, or facilitating user interactions. By structuring conversation histories and contextual relationships in a graphbased framework, GraphRAG systems [5] can improve the modelâ€™s ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n(4) Recommendation. In the context of E-commerce platforms, the purchase relationships between users and products naturally form a network graph. The primary objective of recommendation within these platforms is to predict the future purchasing intentions of users, effectively forecasting the potential connections within this graph [168].\n9.2\nApplication Domains\nGraphRAG is widely applied in E-commerce and biomedical, academic, literature, legal, and other application scenarios for its outstanding ability to integrate structured knowledge graphs with",
