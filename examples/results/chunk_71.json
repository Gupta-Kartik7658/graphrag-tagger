Next, we will introduce five types of graph languages separately: Adjacency /\nEdge Table, Natural Language, Codes, Syntax Tree, and Node Sequence.\n(1) Adjacency / Edge Table. The adjacency table and the edge table are widely used methods for describing graph structures [38, 49, 94, 165]. The adjacency table enumerates the immediate neighbors of each vertex, offering a compact way to represent connections in sparse graphs. For example, KG-GPT [80] linearizes the triples in the retrieved subgraph, which are then concatenated and fed into the LLMs. Conversely, the edge table details all the edges within the graph, providing a straightforward representation that is particularly useful for processing and analyzing graphs in a linear format. Both two methods are brief, easy to understand, and intuitive.\n(2) Natural Language. Given that user queries are typically presented in natural language, and considering the outstanding natural language comprehension capabilities of LMs, it becomes a compelling approach to describe the retrieved graph data using natural language.
