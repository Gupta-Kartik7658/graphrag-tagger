  "chunk": "simultaneously [112]. This method capitalizes on the cohesive capabilities of a unified architecture, enabling the model to seamlessly retrieve relevant information and generate coherent responses within a single framework.\nOther methodologies involve initially training retrievers and generators separately, followed by joint training techniques to fine-tune both components. For instance, Subgraph Retriever [196] adopts an alternating training paradigm, where the retriever’s parameters are fixed to use the graph data for training the generator. Subsequently, the generator’s parameters are fixed, and feedback from the generator is used to guide the retriever’s training. This iterative process helps both components refine their performance in a coordinated manner.\n9\nApplications and Evaluation\nIn this section, we will summarize the downstream tasks, application domains, benchmarks and metrics, and industrial applications related to GraphRAG. Table 1 collects existing GraphRAG techniques, categorizing them by downstream tasks, benchmarks, methods, and evaluation metrics.\nThis table serves as a comprehensive overview, highlighting the various aspects and applications of GraphRAG technologies across different domains.\n9.1\nDownstream Tasks",
