  "chunk": "capabilities of LMs by enabling them to effectively process and utilize structured graph information.\nIn this survey, we summarize two distinct graph formats: graph languages and graph embeddings.\nWe illustrate this process with an example in Figure 6, with detailed introductions provided below.\n7.2.1\nGraph Languages. A graph description language is a formalized system of notation that is specifically crafted to characterize and represent graph data. It prescribes a uniform syntax and semantic framework that describes the components and interconnections within a graph.\nThrough these languages, users can consistently generate, manipulate, and interpret graph data in a comprehensible format to machines. They enable the definition of graph architectures, the specification of attributes for nodes and edges, and the implementation of operations and queries\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.
