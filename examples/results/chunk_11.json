  "chunk": "innovative horizons.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: • We provide a comprehensive and systematic review of existing state-of-the-art GraphRAG methodologies. We offer a formal definition of GraphRAG, outlining its universal workflow which includes G-Indexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation.\n• We discuss the core technologies underpinning existing GraphRAG systems, including GIndexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation. For each component, we analyze the spectrum of model selection, methodological design, and enhancement strategies currently being explored.\nAdditionally, we contrast the diverse training methodologies employed across these modules.\n• We delineate the downstream tasks, benchmarks, application domains, evaluation metrics, current challenges, and future research directions pertinent to GraphRAG, discussing both\nJ.
