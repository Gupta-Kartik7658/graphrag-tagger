  "chunk": "ing graphs into structures akin to syntax trees. Syntax trees possess a hierarchical structure and, being topological graphs, also maintain a topological order. This method retains more structural information, enhancing the understanding and analysis of the graphâ€™s intrinsic properties. Such a transformation not only preserves the relational dynamics between different graph elements but also facilitates more sophisticated algorithms for graph analysis and processing. GRAPHTEXT [201] proposes transforming the ego network of a central node into a graph-syntax tree format. This format not only encapsulates structural information but also integrates the features of the nodes. By traversing this syntax tree, it is possible to obtain a node sequence that maintains both topological order and hierarchical structure.\n(5) Node Sequence. Some studies [18, 119] propose representing graphs through sequences of nodes, which are often generated using predefined rules. Compared to natural language descriptions, these node sequences are more concise and incorporate prior knowledge, specifically the structural\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111.
