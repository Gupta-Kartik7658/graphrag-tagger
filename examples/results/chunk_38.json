G-Retriever [55] enhances the conventional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) algorithm by incorporating edge prices and optimizing relevant subgraph extraction.\nDelile et al. [26] and Mavromatis and Karypis [119] first extract entities mentioned in the query and then retrieve the shortest path related to these entities. These methods often involve an entity linking pre-processing step to identify nodes in the graph before retrieval.\n6.1.2\nLM-based Retriever. LMs serve as effective retrievers in GraphRAG due to their strong natural language understanding capabilities. These models excel in processing and interpreting diverse natural language queries, making them versatile for a wide range of retrieval tasks within graphbased frameworks. We primarily categorized LMs into two types: discriminative and generative language models. Subgraph Retriever [196] trains RoBERTa [107] as the retriever, which expands from the topic entity and retrieves the relevant paths in a sequential decision process. KG-GPT [80]",
