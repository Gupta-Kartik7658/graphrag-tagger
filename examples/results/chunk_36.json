Each of the above three indexing methods offers distinct advantages: graph indexing facilitates easy access to structural information, text indexing simplifies retrieval of textual content, and vector indexing enables quick and efficient searches. Therefore, in practical applications, a hybrid approach combining these indexing methods is often preferred over relying solely on one. For instance, HybridRAG [144] retrieves both vector and graph data simultaneously to enhance the content retrieved. While EWEK-QA [24] uses both text and knowledge graphs.\n6\nGraph-Guided Retrieval\nIn GraphRAG, the retrieval process is crucial for ensuring the quality and relevance of generated outputs by extracting pertinent and high-quality graph data from external graph databases. However, retrieving graph data presents two significant challenges: (1) Explosive Candidate Subgraphs: As the graph size increases, the number of candidate subgraphs grows exponentially, requiring heuristic search algorithms to efficiently explore and retrieve relevant subgraphs. (2) Insufficient Similarity\nMeasurement: Accurately measuring similarity between textual queries and graph data necessitates",
