Distinguished from KBQA, CSQA primarily takes the form of multiple-choice questions.\nCommonsense reasoning typically presents a commonsense question along with several answer options, each potentially representing either the name of an entity or a statement. The objective is for machines to utilize external commonsense knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet, to find relevant knowledge pertaining to the question and options, and to engage in appropriate reasoning and derive the correct answer.\n9.1.2\nInformation Retrieval. Information Retrieval tasks consist of two categories: Entity Linking (EL) and Relation Extraction (RE).\n(1) Entity Linking. Entity Linking (EL) is a critical task in the field of natural language processing that involves identifying entities mentioned in text segments and linking them to their corresponding entities in a knowledge graph. By leveraging a system such as Graph RAG, it is possible to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge graph, which facilitates the accurate inference of the specific entities that match the mentions in the text [180].",
