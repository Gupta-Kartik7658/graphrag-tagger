Because the number of candidate subgraphs can grow exponentially with the size of the graph, efficient approximation methods are necessary. The first line of Equation 4 is thus approximated by the second line. Specifically, a graph retriever is employed to extract the optimal subgraph 𝐺∗, after which the generator produces the answer based on the retrieved subgraph.\nTherefore, in this survey, we decompose the entire process of GraphRAG into three main stages:",
