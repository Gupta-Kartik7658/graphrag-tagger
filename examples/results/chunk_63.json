Sun et al.\n[152] compute PageRank scores for neighboring nodes and aggregates them weighted by these scores, during message-passing. This approach enhances the central nodeâ€™s ability to assimilate information from its most relevant neighboring nodes. Mavromatis and Karypis [118] decode the query into several vectors (instructions), and enhances instruction decoding and execution for effective reasoning by emulating breadth-first search (BFS) with GNNs to improve instruction execution and using adaptive reasoning to update the instructions with KG-aware information.\n7.1.2\nLMs. LMs possess strong capabilities in text understanding, which also allows them to",
