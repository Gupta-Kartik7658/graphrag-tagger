  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 111:15 [158] first select the topic entities and their two-hop neighbors as the node set, and then choose the edges with head and tail entities both in the node set to form the subgraph. Besides, there are also some embedding-based subgraph retrieval methods. For example, Hu et al. [58] first encode all the ùëò-hop ego networks from the graph database, then retrieve subgraphs related to the query based on the similarities between embeddings.\nWen et al. [175] and Li et al. [89] extract two types of graphs, including Path evidence subgraphs and Neighbor evidence subgraphs, based on pre-defined rules. OpenCSR [53] starts from a few initial seed nodes and gradually expands to new nodes, eventually forming a subgraph.\nIn addition to the aforementioned direct subgraph retrieval methods, some works propose first retrieving relevant paths and then constructing related subgraphs from them. For instance, Zhang et al. [196] train a RoBERTa model to identify multiple reasoning paths through a sequential decision process, subsequently merging identical entities from different paths to induce a final subgraph.",
