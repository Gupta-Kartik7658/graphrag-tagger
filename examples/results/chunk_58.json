  "chunk": "paths from each topic entity to form a single subgraph, researchers propose to merge the same entities from different subgraphs to form the final subgraph.\nWen et al. [175] and Li et al. [89] merge retrieved subgraphs based on relations, combining head entities and tail entities that satisfy the same relation into two distinct entity sets, ultimately forming a relation paths.\n(2) Knowledge Pruning. Knowledge pruning involves filtering out less relevant or redundant retrieved information to refine the results. Previous approaches for pruning encompass two main categories: (re)-ranking-based approaches and LLM-based approaches. (Re)-ranking methods involve the reordering or prioritization of retrieved information using tailored metrics or criteria.\nOne line of methods introduces stronger models for reranking. For example, Li et al. [90] concatenate each retrieved triplet with the question-choice pair, and adopt a pre-trained crossencoder [140] to re-rank the retrieved triplets. Jiang et al. [73] utilize the FlagEmbedding to encode the text to re-rank top-k documents returned by embedding model “bge_reranker_large”. Liu et al.",
