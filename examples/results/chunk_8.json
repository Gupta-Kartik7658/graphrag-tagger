  "chunk": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) [32, 58, 119] emerges as an innovative solution to address these challenges. Unlike traditional RAG, GraphRAG retrieves graph elements containing relational knowledge pertinent to a given query from a pre-constructed graph database, as depicted in Figure 1. These elements may include nodes, triples, paths, or subgraphs, which are utilized to generate responses. GraphRAG considers the interconnections between texts, enabling a more accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relational information. Additionally, graph data, such as knowledge graphs, offer abstraction and summarization of textual data, thereby significantly shortening the length of the input text and mitigating concerns of verbosity. By retrieving subgraphs or graph communities, we can access comprehensive information to effectively address the QFS challenge by capturing the broader context and interconnections within the graph structure.\nJ.
