In this section, we categorize and summarize the selection or construction of graph data and various indexing methods that have been employed.\n5.1\nGraph Data\nVarious types of graph data are utilized in GraphRAG for retrieval and generation. Here, we categorize these data into two categories based on their sources, including Open Knowledge Graphs and Self-Constructed Graph Data.\n5.1.1\nOpen Knowledge Graphs. Open knowledge graphs refer to graph data sourced from publicly available repositories or databases [4, 10, 150, 163]. Using these knowledge graphs could dramatically reduce the time and resources required to develop and maintain. In this survey, we further classify them into two categories according to their scopes, i.e., General Knowledge Graphs and Domain\nKnowledge Graphs.\n(1) General Knowledge Graphs. General knowledge graphs primarily store general, structured knowledge, and typically rely on collective input and updates from a global community, ensuring a comprehensive and continually refreshed repository of information.\nEncyclopedic knowledge graphs are a typical type of general knowledge graph, which contains",
