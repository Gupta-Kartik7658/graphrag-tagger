  "chunk": "transform knowledge graphs into human-readable text using predefined rules or templates. For instance,\nLi et al. [90] , Huang et al. [63] and Li et al. [95] use predefined templates to convert each triple in knowledge graphs into natural language, while Yu et al. [193] merge triplets with the same head entity into passages. Additionally, some methods convert subgraph-level information into textual descriptions. For example, Edge et al. [32] perform community detection on the graph and generate summaries for each community using LLMs.\n5.2.3\nVector Indexing. Vector indexing transforms graph data into vector representations to enhance retrieval efficiency, facilitating rapid retrieval and effective query processing. For example, entity linking can be seamlessly applied through query embeddings, and efficient vector search algorithms such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [66] can be utilized. G-Retriever [55] employs language models to encode textual information associated with each node and edge within the graph, while GRAG [58] uses language models to convert ùëò-hop ego networks into graph embeddings, thereby better preserving structural information.",
